26747586	A Multiplexed Amplicon Approach for Detecting Gene Fusions by Next-Generation Sequencing.	Chromosomal rearrangements that result in oncogenic gene fusions are clinically important drivers of many cancer types. Rapid and sensitive methods are therefore needed to detect a broad range of gene fusions in clinical specimens that are often of limited quantity and quality. We describe a next-generation sequencing approach that uses a multiplex PCR-based amplicon panel to interrogate fusion transcripts that involve 19 driver genes and 94 partners implicated in solid tumors. The panel also includes control assays that evaluate the 3'/5' expression ratios of 12 oncogenic kinases, which might be used to infer gene fusion events when the partner is unknown or not included on the panel. There was good concordance between the solid tumor fusion gene panel and other methods, including fluorescence in situ hybridization, real-time PCR, Sanger sequencing, and other next-generation sequencing panels, because 40 specimens known to harbor gene fusions were correctly identified. No specific fusion reads were observed in 59 fusion-negative specimens. The 3'/5' expression ratio was informative for fusions that involved ALK, RET, and NTRK1 but not for BRAF or ROS1 fusions. However, among 37 ALK or RET fusion-negative specimens, four exhibited elevated 3'/5' expression ratios, indicating that fusions predicted solely by 3'/5' read ratios require confirmatory testing.
26784937	NTRK fusion oncogenes in pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma in northeast United States.	BACKGROUND: An increase in thyroid cancers, predominantly papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), has been recently reported in children. METHODS: The histopathology of 28 consecutive PTCs from the northeast United States was reviewed. None of the patients (ages 6-18 years; 20 females, 8 males) had significant exposure to radiation. Nucleic acid from tumors was tested for genetic abnormalities (n = 27). Negative results were reevaluated by targeted next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: Seven of 27 PTCs (26%) had neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor (NTRK) fusion oncogenes (NTRK type 3/ets variant 6 [NTRK3/ETV6], n =5; NTRK3/unknown, n = 1; and NTRK type 1/translocated promoter region, nuclear basket protein [NTRK1/TPR], n = 1), including 5 tumors that measured >2 cm and 3 that diffusely involved the entire thyroid or lobe. All 7 tumors had lymphatic invasion, and 5 had vascular invasion. Six of 27 PTCs (22%) had ret proto-oncogene (RET) fusions (RET/PTC1, n = 5; RET/PTC3, n = 1); 2 tumors measured >2 cm and diffusely involved the thyroid, and 5 had lymphatic invasion, with vascular invasion in 2. Thirteen PTCs had the B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) valine-to-glutamic acid mutation at position 600 (BRAF(V) (600E)) (13 of 27 tumors; 48%), 11 measured <2 cm, and 6 had lymphatic invasion (46%), with vascular invasion in 3. Fusion oncogene tumors, compared with BRAF(V) (600E) PTCs, were associated with large size (mean, 2.2 cm vs 1.5 cm, respectively; P = .05), solid and diffuse variants (11 of 13 vs 0 of 13 tumors, respectively; P < .001), and lymphovascular invasion (12 of 13 vs 6 of 13 tumors, respectively; P = .02); BRAF(V) (600E) PTCs were predominantly the classic variant (12 of 13 vs 1 of 13 tumors). Two tumors metastasized to the lung, and both had fusion oncogenes (NTRK1/TPR, n = 1; RET/PTC1, n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: Fusion oncogene PTC presents with more extensive disease and aggressive pathology than BRAF(V) (600E) PTC in the pediatric population. The high prevalence of the NTRK1/NTRK3 fusion oncogene PTCs in the United States is unusual and needs further investigation.
26973202	ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements in lung squamous cell carcinoma are very rare.	OBJECTIVES: Chromosomal rearrangements of ALK and ROS1 genes in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) define a molecular subgroup of lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) that is amenable to targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) crizotinib. Emerging clinical studies have demonstrated that patients with RET-rearranged NSCLC may also benefit from existing RET TKIs, including cabozantinib and vandetanib. However, the reported cases of lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) harboring gene rearrangements have been detected via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) from materials such as biopsy or resection. Fusion events identified in lung SCC raise the question of whether this histologic subtype should also be evaluated for merit molecular testing. This work was undertaken to study the prevalence of lung SCC harboring ALK, ROS1, and RET translocations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Squamous cell carcinomas were confirmed using both histological examination by pathologists and immunohistochemistry analysis with positive staining of P63 and CK5/6 combined with negative CK7 and TTF-1 staining. 214 samples from surgically resected patient tissues were used to search for ALK, ROS1, and RET rearrangements by a NanoString analysis method. Fusion events were detected in a single-tube, multiplex assay system that relied on a complementary strategy of interrogation of 3' gene overexpression and detection of specific fusion transcript variants. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: ALK, ROS1 or RET gene rearrangements appeared 0 times out of 214 cases of lung SCC. Our data revealed that these fusions may be very rare in lung squamous cancer. The molecular screening strategy should therefore be focused on lung adenocarcinoma as the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline recommends.
27259011	Recurrent NTRK1 Gene Fusions Define a Novel Subset of Locally Aggressive Lipofibromatosis-like Neural Tumors.	The family of pediatric fibroblastic and myofibroblastic proliferations encompasses a wide spectrum of pathologic entities with overlapping morphologies and ill-defined genetic abnormalities. Among the superficial lesions, lipofibromatosis (LPF), composed of an admixture of adipose tissue and fibroblastic elements, in the past has been variously classified as infantile fibromatosis or fibrous hamartoma of infancy. In this regard, we have encountered a group of superficial soft tissue tumors occurring in children and young adults, with a notably infiltrative growth pattern reminiscent of LPF, variable cytologic atypia, and a distinct immunoprofile of S100 protein and CD34 reactivity, suggestive of neural differentiation. SOX10 and melanocytic markers were negative in all cases tested. In contrast, a control group of classic LPF displayed bland, monomorphic histology and lacked S100 protein immunoreactivity. To define the pathogenetic abnormalities in these seemingly distinctive groups, we performed RNA sequencing for fusion gene discovery in 2 cases each, followed by screening for any novel alterations identified in a larger cohort representing both entities. The 2 index LPF-like neural tumors (LPF-NT) showed TPR-NTRK1 and TPM3-NTRK1 gene fusions, which were further validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Subsequent FISH screening of 14 LPF-NT identified recurrent NTRK1 gene rearrangements in 10 (71%) cases. Of the NTRK1-negative LPF-NT cases, 1 case each showed ROS1 and ALK gene rearrangements. In contrast, none of the 25 classic LPFs showed NTRK1 gene rearrangements, although regional abnormalities were noted in the 1q21-22 region by FISH in a majority of cases. Furthermore, NTRK1 immunostaining was positive only in NTRK1-rearranged S100-positive LPF-NT but negative in classic LPF. These results suggest that NTRK1 oncogenic activation through gene fusion defines a novel and distinct subset of soft tissue tumors resembling LPF, but displaying cytologic atypia and a neural immunophenotype, provisionally named LPF-like neural tumors.
27343444	Custom Gene Capture and Next-Generation Sequencing to Resolve Discordant ALK Status by FISH and IHC in Lung Adenocarcinoma.	INTRODUCTION: We performed a genomic study in lung adenocarcinoma cases with discordant anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) status by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. METHODS: DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 16 discordant (four FISH-positive/IHC-negative and 12 FISH-negative/IHC-positive) cases by Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH and ALK IHC testing (ALK1 clone) were subjected to whole gene capture and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of nine genes, including ALK, echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4 gene (EML4), kinesin family member 5B gene (KIF5B), staphylococcal nuclease and tudor domain containing 1 gene (SND1), BRAF, ret proto-oncogene (RET), ezrin gene (EZR), ROS1, and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). All discordant cases (except one FISH-negative/IHC-positive case without sufficient tissue) were analyzed by IHC with D5F3 antibody. In one case with fresh frozen tissue, whole transcriptome sequencing was also performed. Twenty-six concordant (16 FISH-positive/IHC-positive and 10 FISH-negative/IHC-negative) cases were included as controls. RESULTS: In four ALK FISH-positive/IHC-negative cases, no EML4-ALK fusion gene was observed by NGS, but in one case using fresh frozen tissue, we identified EML4-baculoviral AIP repeat containing 6 gene (BIRC6) and AP2 associated kinase 1 gene (AAK1)-ALK fusion genes. Whole transcriptome sequencing revealed a highly expressed EML4-BIRC6 fusion transcript and a minimally expressed AAK1 transcript. Among the 12 FISH-negative/IHC-positive cases, no evidence of ALK gene rearrangement was detected by NGS. Eleven of 12 FISH-negative/IHC-positive cases detected by ALK1 clone were concordant by repeat ALK IHC with D5F3 antibody (i.e., FISH-negative/IHC-negative by D5F3 clone). Among the 16 ALK FISH-positive/IHC-positive positive controls, whole gene capture identified ALK gene fusion in 15 cases, including in one case with Huntington interacting protein 1 gene (HIP1)-ALK. No ALK fusion gene was observed in any of the 10 FISH-negative/IHC-negative cases. Other fusion genes involving ROS1, EZR, BRAF, and SND1 were also found. CONCLUSIONS: ALK FISH results appeared to be false-positive in three of four FISH-positive/IHC-negative cases, whereas no false-negative ALK FISH case was identified among 12 ALK FISH-negative/IHC-positive cases by ALK1 clone, which was in keeping with the concordant FISH-negative/IHC-negative status by D5F3 clone. Our targeted whole gene capture approach using formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples was effective for detecting rearrangements involving ALK and other actionable oncogenes.
28013235	Kinase impact assessment in the landscape of fusion genes that retain kinase domains: a pan-cancer study.	Assessing the impact of kinase in gene fusion is essential for both identifying driver fusion genes (FGs) and developing molecular targeted therapies. Kinase domain retention is a crucial factor in kinase fusion genes (KFGs), but such a systematic investigation has not been done yet. To this end, we analyzed kinase domain retention (KDR) status in chimeric protein sequences of 914 KFGs covering 312 kinases across 13 major cancer types. Based on 171 kinase domain-retained KFGs including 101 kinases, we studied their recurrence, kinase groups, fusion partners, exon-based expression depth, short DNA motifs around the break points and networks. Our results, such as more KDR than 5'-kinase fusion genes, combinatorial effects between 3'-KDR kinases and their 5'-partners and a signal transduction-specific DNA sequence motif in the break point intronic sequences, supported positive selection on 3'-kinase fusion genes in cancer. We introduced a degree-of-frequency (DoF) score to measure the possible number of KFGs of a kinase. Interestingly, kinases with high DoF scores tended to undergo strong gene expression alteration at the break points. Furthermore, our KDR gene fusion network analysis revealed six of the seven kinases with the highest DoF scores (ALK, BRAF, MET, NTRK1, NTRK3 and RET) were all observed in thyroid carcinoma. Finally, we summarized common features of 'effective' (highly recurrent) kinases in gene fusions such as expression alteration at break point, redundant usage in multiple cancer types and 3'-location tendency. Collectively, our findings are useful for prioritizing driver kinases and FGs and provided insights into KFGs' clinical implications.
28073897	Identification of ALK, ROS1, and RET Fusions by a Multiplexed mRNA-Based Assay in Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Samples from Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients.	BACKGROUND: Anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK), ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1), and ret proto-oncogene (RET) fusions are present in 5%-7% of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); their accurate identification is critical to guide targeted therapies. FISH and immunohistochemistry (IHC) are considered the gold standards to determine gene fusions, but they have limitations. The nCounter platform is a potentially useful genomic tool for multiplexed detection of gene fusions, but has not been validated in the clinical setting. METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples from 108 patients with advanced NSCLC were analyzed with an nCounter-based assay and the results compared with FISH, IHC, and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Data on response to fusion kinase inhibitors was retrospectively collected in a subset of 29 patients. RESULTS: Of 108 FFPE samples, 98 were successfully analyzed by nCounter (91%), which identified 55 fusion-positive cases (32 ALK, 21 ROS1, and 2 RET). nCounter results were highly concordant with IHC for ALK (98.5%, CI = 91.8-99.7), while 11 discrepancies were found compared with FISH (87.5% concordance, CI = 79.0-92.9). For ROS1, nCounter showed similar agreement with IHC and FISH (87.2% and 85.9%), but a substantial number of samples were positive only by 1 or 2 techniques. Of the 25 patients deriving clinical benefit from fusion kinase inhibitors, 24 were positive by nCounter and 22 by FISH. CONCLUSIONS: nCounter compares favorably with IHC and FISH and can be used for identifying patients with advanced NSCLC positive for ALK/ROS1/RET fusion genes.
28088512	ROS1 Fusions Rarely Overlap with Other Oncogenic Drivers in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Chromosomal rearrangements involving the gene ROS1 define a distinct molecular subset of NSCLCs with sensitivity to ROS1 inhibitors. Recent reports have suggested a significant overlap between ROS1 fusions and other oncogenic driver alterations, including mutations in EGFR and KRAS. METHODS: We identified patients at our institution with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC who had undergone testing for genetic alterations in additional oncogenes, including EGFR, KRAS, and anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK). Clinicopathologic features and genetic testing results were reviewed. We also examined a separate database of ROS1-rearranged NSCLCs identified through the commercial FoundationOne assay (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA). RESULTS: Among 62 patients with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC evaluated at our institution, none harbored concurrent ALK fusions (0%) or EGFR activating mutations (0%). KRAS mutations were detected in two cases (3.2%), one of which harbored a concurrent noncanonical KRAS I24N mutation of unknown biological significance. In a separate ROS1 fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive case, targeted sequencing failed to confirm a ROS1 fusion but instead identified a KRAS G13D mutation. No concurrent mutations in B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase gene (BRAF), erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 gene (ERBB2), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha gene (PIK3CA), AKT/serine threonine kinase 1 gene (AKT1), or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 gene (MAP2K1) were detected. Analysis of an independent data set of 166 ROS1-rearranged NSCLCs identified by FoundationOne demonstrated rare cases with co-occurring driver mutations in EGFR (one of 166) and KRAS (three of 166) and no cases with co-occurring ROS1 and ALK rearrangements. CONCLUSIONS: ROS1 rearrangements rarely overlap with alterations in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, or other targetable oncogenes in NSCLC.
28433076	Identification of NTRK3 Fusions in Childhood Melanocytic Neoplasms.	Spitzoid neoplasms are a distinct group of melanocytic tumors. Genetically, they lack mutations in common melanoma-associated oncogenes. Recent studies have shown that spitzoid tumors may contain a variety of kinase fusions, including ROS1, NTRK1, ALK, BRAF, and RET fusions. We report herein the discovery of recurrent NTRK3 gene rearrangements in childhood melanocytic neoplasms with spitzoid and/or atypical features, based on genome-wide copy number analysis by single-nucleotide polymorphism array, which showed intragenic copy number changes in NTRK3. Break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of NTRK3 rearrangement, and a novel MYO5A-NTRK3 transcript, representing an in-frame fusion of MYO5A exon 32 to NTRK3 exon 12, was identified using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends-based anchored multiplex PCR assay followed by next-generation sequencing. The predicted MYO5A-NTRK3 fusion protein consists of several N-terminal coiled-coil protein dimerization motifs encoded by MYO5A and C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain encoded by NTRK3, which is consistent with the prototypical structure of TRK oncogenic fusions. Our study also demonstrates how array-based copy number analysis can be useful in discovering gene fusions associated with unbalanced genomic aberrations flanking the fusion points. Our findings add another potentially targetable kinase fusion to the list of oncogenic fusions in melanocytic tumors.
28724272	Patients' Characteristics, Histopathological Findings, and Tumor Stage in Different Types of Malignant Melanoma: A Retrospective Multicenter Study.	Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) is currently the most fatal of skin cancers accounting for 50000 deaths annually. Five distinct melanomas are described histopathologically: superficial spreading, lentigo maligna, nodular, acral lentiginous and mucosal melanoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of patients with various types of malignant melanoma and evaluate histopathological findings. In this retrospective study, we obtained our data from the records of 111 patients with melanoma. Biopsied specimens were collected and re-evaluated. Demographic information and histopathological findings were noted. SPSS 16 was used for analyzing data. Chi-square and one-way ANOVA was conducted for comparing categorical and numerical variables respectively. The mean age of patients was 59.33±14.68 years old. Most common melanoma type was acral lentiginous (40.5%), followed by nodular (35.1%) and mucosal (10.8%). The highest tumor thickness was viewed in nodular melanoma followed by mucosal melanoma. The highest rate of metastasis, microsatellitosis, perineural invasion and Clark level of the invasion were reported in nodular and acral lentiginous respectively. The most frequent rate of ulceration and vascular invasion was reported in mucosal melanoma. Distribution of melanoma types varies largely in different regions. Lack of classic presentations in some types necessitate specific public education about warning signs. Histopathological and pathological characteristics in melanoma can aid in better staging and management of the tumor.
29464758	A genomic and clinicopathological study of non-small-cell lung cancers with discordant ROS1 gene status by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemical analysis.	AIMS: ROS1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) using D4D6 antibody is a useful tool for screening patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who may be suitable for targeted therapy. Many studies and our data have identified cases that express the ROS1 protein strongly but are negative for ROS1 by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH). The present study investigated the driver mutation and clinicopathological characteristics of 26 discordant cases (ROS1 IHC-positive but FISH-negative) to find new clues for distinguishing real ROS1-rearranged cases. METHODS AND RESULTS: Tumours from 26 discordant cases were analysed for clinicopathological characteristics, mutations in EGFR, KRAS, ERBB2, BRAF and PIK3CA; fusions in ALK and RET; and amplifications in MET, ERBB2 and ROS1. ROS1-rearranged NSCLCs were significantly more likely to be found in younger patients and at an advanced stage; they showed cribriform features, extracellular mucus and psammoma bodies, whereas ROS1-discordant cases were found in older patients at a relatively early tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and showed a lepidic growth pattern (all P < 0.001). Most ROS1-rearranged NSCLCs had no concurrent mutation, whereas 73% of discordant cases harboured genetic aberrations, including EGFR and ERBB2. Compared with general lung adenocarcinomas, ERBB-2 abnormality was disproportionately high in ROS1-discordant cases. Moreover, we optimised the scoring criteria for ROS1 IHC as 'H score > 150 and no concurrent mutations'; the specificity was then increased to 81.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with ROS1-rearranged cases, ROS1-discordant patients showed distinct clinical and morphological features and often harboured another oncogenic driver alteration. The use of optimised screening criteria will increase the specificity of ROS1 antibody.
29768105	Identification of a Recurrent LMO7-BRAF Fusion in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: The BRAFV600E mutation is the most common driver in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tumors. In recent years, gene fusions have also been recognized as important drivers of cancer in PTC. Previous studies have suggested that thyroid tumors with fusion genes frequently display an aggressive course. These observations prompted further exploration of gene fusions in PTC tumors. The aim was to search for previously unrecognized gene fusions using thyroid tissue samples from PTC patients. METHODS: Gene fusions were analyzed in RNA sequencing data obtained from 12 PTC tumors and paired unaffected thyroid tissue samples. Candidate fusions were further filtered and validated using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Sanger sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. An Ohio cohort of 148 PTC tumor samples was screened for a LMO7-BRAF fusion and the BRAFV600E mutation. Functional assays were performed to assess the LMO7-BRAF fusion. RESULTS: Two coding fusions (CCDC6-RET and LMO7-BRAF) were found in one tumor sample each. The novel LMO7-BRAF fusion was validated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The LMO7-BRAF fusion was a recurrent somatic alteration with a frequency of 2.0% (3/148) in PTC tumors, while the BRAFV600E point mutation was found in 63.5% (94/148) of tumors. Enforced expression of LMO7-BRAF fusion protein stimulated endogenous ERK1/2 phosphorylation and promoted anchorage independent cell growth to an extent similar to BRAFV600E. CONCLUSIONS: A novel fusion gene, LMO7-BRAF, was identified in PTC tumors. The results indicate that the LMO7-BRAF fusion behaves as an oncogenic alteration. This observation expands the spectrum of fusion genes involving kinases in thyroid cancer.
29500396	Retinal microvascular parameters are not associated with reduced renal function in a study of individuals with type 2 diabetes.	The eye provides an opportunistic "window" to view the microcirculation. There is published evidence of an association between retinal microvascular calibre and renal function measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Beyond vascular calibre, few studies have considered other microvascular geometrical features. Here we report novel null findings for measures of vascular spread (vessel fractal dimension), tortuosity, and branching patterns and their relationship with renal function in type 2 diabetes over a mean of 3 years. We performed a nested case-control comparison of multiple retinal vascular parameters between individuals with type 2 diabetes and stable (non-progressors) versus declining (progressors) eGFR across two time points within a subset of 1072 participants from the GoDARTS study cohort. Retinal microvascular were measured using VAMPIRE 3.1 software. In unadjusted analyses and following adjustment for age, gender, systolic blood pressure, HbA1C, and diabetic retinopathy, no associations between baseline retinal vascular parameters and risk of eGFR progression were observed. Cross-sectional analysis of follow-up data showed a significant association between retinal arteriolar diameter and eGFR, but this was not maintained following adjustment. These findings are consistent with a lack of predictive capacity for progressive loss of renal function in type 2 diabetes.
17966124	Is depression associated with microvascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes?	We hypothesize that late-life depression is a manifestation of microvascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a clinic-based cross-sectional study, comparing retinal vascular caliber, a marker of microvascular disease, in participants with type 2 diabetes with major depression (n=34), without depression (n=27) and healthy non-diabetic controls (n=38). Retinal vascular caliber was measured from digital retinal photographs using a validated computer-assisted method. After adjusting for age and gender, there was a trend of increasing retinal arteriolar caliber from healthy controls (132.6 microm), to diabetic patients without depression (139.2 microm), and diabetic patients with major depression (145.3 microm, P=0.008). The trend in retinal arteriolar caliber remains significant after adjusting for duration of diabetes, but not after further adjusting for vascular risk factors. Our findings suggest that there is variation in the retinal vascular caliber between type 2 diabetic patients with and without major depression and non-diabetic controls. This variation was largely related to poorer diabetes control and a higher frequency of vascular risk factors in diabetic patients, particularly those with depression. Studies with larger sample size may provide further insights into this association.
18184895	Retinal arteriolar caliber predicts incident retinopathy: the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study.	Changes in retinal vascular caliber may reflect subclinical microvascular disease and provide prognostic information regarding risk of retinopathy. In this study, we examined the prospective association of retinal vascular caliber with retinopathy risk in an Australian population-based cohort. A total of 906 participants without retinopathy at baseline had retinal vascular caliber measured from photographs and were followed-up for 5 years for incident retinopathy. After adjusting for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, A1C, and other risk factors, individuals with wider retinal arteriolar caliber (widest 25% vs. the remaining three-quarters of the population) were more likely to develop incident retinopathy (odds ratio 4.79 [95% CI 1.57-14.58]). This association was not significant in individuals without diabetes. Venular caliber did not predict incident retinopathy. Our findings suggest that retinal arteriolar dilatation is a specific sign of diabetic microvascular dysfunction and may be a preclinical marker of diabetic retinopathy.
18523143	Retinal arteriolar dilation predicts retinopathy in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.	OBJECTIVE: Alterations in retinal vascular caliber may reflect early subclinical microvascular dysfunction. In this study, we examined the association of retinal vascular caliber to incident retinopathy in young patients with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of 645 initially retinopathy-free type 1 diabetic patients, aged 12-20 years. Participants had seven-field stereoscopic retinal photographs taken of both eyes at baseline and follow-up. Retinal vascular caliber was measured from baseline photographs using a computer-based program following a standardized protocol. Incident retinopathy was graded according to the modified Airlie House classification from follow-up photographs. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 274 participants developed retinopathy (14.8 per 100 person-years). After adjustments for age, sex, diabetes duration, glycemia, mean arterial blood pressure, BMI, and cholesterol levels, larger retinal arteriolar caliber (fourth versus first quartile) was associated with a more than threefold higher risk of retinopathy (hazard rate ratio 3.44 [95% CI 2.08-5.66]). Each SD increase in retinal arteriolar caliber was associated with a 46% increase in retinopathy risk (1.46 [1.22-1.74]). This association was stronger in female than in male participants. After similar adjustments, retinal venular caliber was not consistently associated with incident retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal arteriolar dilatation predicts retinopathy development in young patients with type 1 diabetes. Our data suggest that arteriolar dysfunction may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of early diabetic retinopathy and that computer-based retinal vascular caliber measurements may provide additional prognostic information regarding risk of diabetes microvascular complications.
18835945	Quantitative assessment of early diabetic retinopathy using fractal analysis.	OBJECTIVE: Fractal analysis can quantify the geometric complexity of the retinal vascular branching pattern and may therefore offer a new method to quantify early diabetic microvascular damage. In this study, we examined the relationship between retinal fractal dimension and retinopathy in young individuals with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 729 patients with type 1 diabetes (aged 12-20 years) who had seven-field stereoscopic retinal photographs taken of both eyes. From these photographs, retinopathy was graded according to the modified Airlie House classification, and fractal dimension was quantified using a computer-based program following a standardized protocol. RESULTS: In this study, 137 patients (18.8%) had diabetic retinopathy signs; of these, 105 had mild retinopathy. Median (interquartile range) retinal fractal dimension was 1.46214 (1.45023-1.47217). After adjustment for age, sex, diabetes duration, A1C, blood pressure, and total cholesterol, increasing retinal vascular fractal dimension was significantly associated with increasing odds of retinopathy (odds ratio 3.92 [95% CI 2.02-7.61] for fourth versus first quartile of fractal dimension). In multivariate analysis, each 0.01 increase in retinal vascular fractal dimension was associated with a nearly 40% increased odds of retinopathy (1.37 [1.21-1.56]). This association remained after additional adjustment for retinal vascular caliber. CONCLUSIONS: Greater retinal fractal dimension, representing increased geometric complexity of the retinal vasculature, is independently associated with early diabetic retinopathy signs in type 1 diabetes. Fractal analysis of fundus photographs may allow quantitative measurement of early diabetic microvascular damage.
19173676	Comparison of the retinal microvasculature in European and African-Caribbean people with diabetes.	Diabetes aggravates the impact of elevated BP (blood pressure) on the microcirculation, and people of African ancestry with diabetes are more susceptible to microvascular damage than Europeans. In the present study, we investigated possible differences in the retinal microcirculation in people of European and African-Caribbean ethnicity with diabetes that might account for this. A total of 51 subjects with Type 2 diabetes (age 40-65 years; 25 male; 29 African-Caribbean) were studied. Clinic and 24 h ambulatory BP, and fasting glucose, insulin and lipids were measured. Digital retinal images were analysed using custom-written semi-automatic software to determine: LDR (length/diameter ratio) and AVR (arteriolar/venular diameter ratio), branching angles, vessel tortuosity and NT (number of terminal vessel branches). Arterioles were narrower in European people with diabetes than in African-Caribbean people with diabetes [mean (S.D.) arteriolar diameter, 76 (7) compared with 82 (11) microm respectively (P=0.03); arteriolar LDR, 28.1 (8.5) compared with 23.7 (7.0) respectively (P=0.046); and AVR, 0.66 (0.21) compared with 0.90 (0.36) respectively (P=0.028)]. Ethnic differences in arteriolar LDR, arteriolar diameter and AVR were not explained by differences in BP, but were attenuated by adjustment for the duration of diabetes. There was no significant relationship between BP and arteriolar narrowing in the group as a whole, although the relationship between arteriolar LDR and systolic BP was stronger in Europeans than African-Caribbeans [beta=0.08 (0.07) compared with beta=0.03 (0.06); P=0.03]. In conclusion, in the presence of diabetes, a relationship between BP and retinal arteriolar diameter was not evident and implies impaired small artery remodelling in the presence of diabetes. African-Caribbean people with diabetes have wider retinal arterioles and this could contribute to enhanced microvascular damage in this ethnic group.
20176399	Retinal vascular fractals and microvascular and macrovascular complications in type 1 diabetes.	PURPOSE: Fractal analysis is a method to quantify the geometric pattern and complexity of the retinal vessels. This study examined the association of retinal fractal dimension (D(f)) and microvascular and macrovascular complications in a population-based cohort of Danish patients with type 1 diabetes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: This was a cross-sectional study of 208 long-term surviving type 1 diabetes patients from a population-based Danish cohort identified in 1973. METHODS: Retinal photographs were obtained at a clinical examination in 2007 or 2008. D(f) was measured with a semiautomatic computer-based program (International Retinal Imaging Software; National University of Singapore, Republic of Singapore; University of Sydney, Sydney, and University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia). D(f) of the retinal vasculature was measured within a predefined circular region of 3.5 optic disc radii centered on the optic disc. Line tracing of the vasculature was provided by the program. Any artifacts were removed by the grader, and the box-counting method then was used by the program to calculate D(f). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The association of D(f) with proliferative retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and macrovascular disease (coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease) was examined. RESULTS: Retinal fractals were gradable in at least 1 eye in 178 (86.6%) of 208 patients. Median age and duration of diabetes for these patients were 57.8 years and 42 years, respectively. Median D(f) was 1.4610 (range, 1.3774-1.5188). After adjustments for age, gender, duration of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, and smoking, persons with lower D(f) were more likely to have proliferative retinopathy (odds ratio [OR], 1.45 per standard deviation [SD] decrease in D(f); 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.03) and neuropathy (OR, 1.42 per SD decrease in D(f); 95% CI, 1.01-2.01). There was also a trend of an association between lower D(f) and nephropathy (OR, 1.39 per SD decrease in D(f); 95% CI, 0.97-2.01) but not macrovascular disease. Furthermore, persons with lower D(f) were older. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the evidence that D(f) may have some role as a global measure of retinal vasculature and its association with systemic disease. Prospective studies clarifying this role are needed. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.
20299479	Alterations in retinal microvascular geometry in young type 1 diabetes.	OBJECTIVE: To describe retinal microvascular geometric parameters in young patients with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 1 diabetes (aged 12-20 years) had clinical assessments and retinal photography following standardized protocol at a tertiary-care hospital in Sydney. Retinal microvascular geometry, including arteriolar and venular tortuosity, branching angles, optimality deviation, and length-to-diameter ratio (LDR), were measured from digitized photographs. Associations of these geometric characteristics with diabetes duration, A1C level, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and other risk factors were assessed. RESULTS: Of 1,159 patients enrolled, 944 (81.4%) had gradable photographs and 170 (14.7%) had retinopathy. Older age was associated with decreased arteriolar (P = 0.024) and venular (P = 0.002) tortuosity, and female subjects had larger arteriolar branching angle than male subjects (P = 0.03). After adjusting for age and sex, longer diabetes duration was associated with larger arteriolar branching angle (P <or= 0.001) and increased arteriolar optimality deviation (P = 0.018), higher A1C was associated with increased arteriolar tortuosity (>8.5 vs. <or=8.5%, P = 0.008), higher SBP was associated with decreased arteriolar LDR (P = 0.002), and higher total cholesterol levels were associated with increased arteriolar LDR (P = 0.044) and decreased venular optimality deviation (P = 0.044). These associations remained after controlling for A1C, retinal vessel caliber, and retinopathy status and were seen in subjects without retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Key diabetes-related factors affect retinal microvascular geometry in young type 1 diabetes, even in those without evidence of retinopathy. These early retinal alterations may be markers of diabetes microvascular complications.
20368470	Evidence of early retinal microvascular changes in patients with type 2 diabetes and depression.	OBJECTIVE: To examine retinal vascular caliber, an indicator of early microvascular disease and depression in patients with Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We conducted a clinic-based study, comparing participants with Type 2 diabetes with major depression (n = 43), without depression (n = 49), and healthy controls without diabetes or depression (n = 54). Retinal vascular caliber was measured from digital photographs. Depression status was determined, using standardized clinical assessment. RESULTS: After adjusting for age and gender, participants with diabetes and depression had larger arteriolar and venular calibers (147.7 microm for arteriolar and 215.7 microm for venular calibers) than participants with diabetes but without depression (143.3 microm and 213.9 microm) and healthy controls (135.8 microm and 202.5 microm, p for trend = .002 for arteriolar and p = .02 for venular caliber). In multivariate models adjusting for duration of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, serum glucose, Cerebrovascular Risk Factor Scale, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, and retinopathy levels, this relationship remained significant for retinal arterioles (p = .02) but not for retinal venules (p = .10). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that patients with Type 2 diabetes with major depression have wider retinal arterioles, supporting the concept that depression is associated with early microvascular changes in Type 2 diabetes.
20523965	Retinal fractal dimension is increased in persons with diabetes but not impaired glucose metabolism: the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study.	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The fractal dimension (D(f)) of the retinal vasculature is a global measure of its branching pattern complexity. We examined the relationship of retinal D(f) with diabetes. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1,577 participants with diabetes and impaired glucose metabolism and normal controls from the population-based Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study. Retinal D(f) was quantified from fundus photographs using a computer-based programme and diabetes status was determined by oral glucose tolerance test based on the WHO criteria. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex and vascular risk factors, persons with higher retinal D(f) were more likely to have diabetes (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.14-2.14, highest vs lowest fractal tertile). This relationship remained with further adjustment for retinal arteriolar calibre and presence of retinopathy (OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.19-2.27), and after excluding participants with retinopathy (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.16-2.21). Retinal D (f) was not related to impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose (OR 1.19; 95% CI 0.85-1.67). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Individuals with diabetes, but not with impaired glucose metabolism, have greater retinal D(f), reflecting greater complexity of the retinal vasculature. Our findings suggest the presence of early microvascular changes in the retinal vasculature of persons with diabetes, even in the absence of overt retinopathy.
21439697	Bidirectional association of retinal vessel diameters and estimated GFR decline: the Beaver Dam CKD Study.	BACKGROUND: Recent cross-sectional studies have reported an association between retinal vessel caliber and chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the direction of the association between these 2 processes is not clear. In a prospective study with multiple measurements of retinal vessel diameters and serum creatinine, we examined whether baseline retinal vessel diameter is associated with future risk of decreased kidney function, or vice versa. STUDY DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 3,199 Wisconsin adults aged 43-84 years who were followed up prospectively for 15 years. PREDICTOR: Baseline retinal arteriolar and venular diameters for analysis 1 and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) categories for analysis 2. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: For analysis 1, incident CKD, defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) accompanied by a 25% decrease in eGFR, during follow-up. For analysis 2, incident retinal arteriolar narrowing, defined as a central retinal arteriolar equivalent measurement <144.0 μm, and incident retinal venular dilation, defined as a central retinal venular equivalent measurement >243.8 μm. RESULTS: Baseline retinal arteriolar and venular diameters were not associated with 15-year risk of incident CKD. After adjustment for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, and other confounders, the multivariable HR of incident CKD comparing the narrowest with the widest quartile was 1.15 (95% CI, 0.74-1.80) for retinal arteriolar diameter and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.67-1.67) for retinal venular diameter. Similarly, there was no significant association between eGFR and 15-year risk of incident retinal arteriolar narrowing or retinal venular widening. Compared with eGFR >90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (referent), the multivariable HR for those with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was 1.66 (95% CI, 0.93-2.96) for incident retinal arteriolar narrowing and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.17-1.85) for retinal venular widening. LIMITATIONS: Lack of data for albuminuria and loss to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal vessel diameters and CKD may run together through shared mechanisms, but are not causally related.
21443578	Eye complications and markers of morbidity and mortality in long-term type 1 diabetes.	The incidence of type 1 diabetes is rising all over the world. Furthermore, the increased life-expectancy of type 1 diabetic patients is likely to cause a higher number of diabetes-related micro- and macrovascular complications in the years to come. In order to examine the level of long-term complications in type 1 diabetes as well as potential markers of micro- and macroangiopathy, a population-based cohort of Danish type 1 diabetic patients was examined in order to achieve the following aims: 1. To evaluate diabetic retinopathy as a long-term marker of all-cause mortality in type 1 diabetes (Paper I). 2. To estimate the long-term incidence and associated risk factors of blindness (Paper II) and cataract surgery (Paper III) in type 1 diabetes. 3 To use retinal vascular analyses in order to investigate the associations of long-term micro- and macrovascular complications and retinal vascular diameters (Paper IV) and retinal fractals (Paper V) in type 1 diabetes. 4. To examine N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (Paper VI) and osteoprotegerin (Paper VII) as non-invasive markers of micro- and macrovascular complications in type 1 diabetes. In Paper I it was a major finding that, despite a mean age of only 38.3 years at baseline, 44.7% of the patients died during the 25-year follow-up. Patients who had proliferative retinopathy as well as proteinuria at the baseline examination had a significantly higher mortality. For these, the 10-year survival was only 22.2%. As demonstrated in Paper II, blindness is an important issue in type 1 diabetes. The 25-year cumulative incidence of blindness was 7.5%. Glycaemic regulation and maculopathy at baseline were both identified as risk factors of blindness. Finally, mortality was higher in patients who went blind during the follow-up. Cataract surgery is quite common in type 1 diabetes. In Paper III a 25-year cumulative incidence of 20.8% was found. Adjusted for mortality, this was even higher (29.4%). As compared to patients without diabetes, cataract surgery takes place approximately 20 years earlier in type 1 diabetic patients. Age and maculopathy at baseline were both identified as predictors of cataract surgery. In Paper IV it was demonstrated that patients with retinal arteriolar narrowing were 2.17 and 3.17 times more likely to have nephropathy and macrovascular disease, respectively. This was an important finding that suggests that retinal fundus photos may be used in order to predict the risk of non-ophthalmological complications in type 1 diabetes. Retinal fractal analysis is another way to evaluate the vascular system of the retina. In Paper V we found associations between retinal fractal and microvascular - but not macrovascular--disease. For instance, patients with lower fractal dimensions were more likely to have proliferative retinopathy (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04-2.03) and neuropathy (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.01-2.01). NT-proBNP is likely to be a future predictor of diabetes-related complications. In Paper VI higher levels of NT-proBNP were related to nephropathy (OR 5.03, 95% CI 1.77-14.25), neuropathy (OR 4.08, 95% CI 1.52-10.97) and macrovascular disease (OR 5.84, 95% CI 1.65-20.74). These associations should be confirmed in future prospective studies. As opposed to NT-proBNP, osteoprotegerin is less likely to be a predictor of either micro- or macrovascular disease in type 1 diabetes. As demonstrated in Paper VII, even though association between higher levels of OPG and nephropathy were found in an age- and sex-adjusted model (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.09-5.90), this was no longer statistically significant when other factors were taken into account. Overall, it was demonstrated that various complications such as mortality, blindness and cataract surgery were high in type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, retinal arteriolar narrowing, decreased retinal fractals and plasma NT-proBNP were associated with various micro- and macrovascular complications. If confirmed by prospective studies, these modalities may be used in order to identify patients at risk of diabetes-related complications. This could, ultimately, lead to decreased mortality and morbidity in type 1 diabetic patients.
21558958	Quantitative and qualitative retinal microvascular characteristics and blood pressure.	OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the effects of blood pressure on a spectrum of quantitative and qualitative retinal microvascular signs. METHODS: Retinal photographs from the Singapore Malay Eye Study, a population-based cross-sectional study of 3280 (78.7% response) persons aged 40-80 years, were analyzed. Quantitative changes in the retinal vasculature (branching angle, vascular tortuosity, fractal dimension, and vascular caliber) were measured using a semi-automated computer-based program. Qualitative signs, including focal arteriolar narrowing (FAN), arteriovenous nicking (AVN), opacification of the arteriolar wall (OAW), and retinopathy (e.g., microaneurysms, retinal hemorrhages), were assessed from photographs by trained technicians. After excluding persons with diabetes and ungradable photographs, 1913 persons provided data for this analysis. RESULTS: In multivariable linear regression models controlling for age, sex, BMI, use of antihypertensive medication, and other factors, retinal arteriolar branching asymmetry ratio, arteriolar tortuosity, venular tortuosity, fractal dimension, arteriolar caliber, venular caliber, FAN, AVN, and retinopathy were independently associated with mean arterial blood pressure. In contrast, arteriolar/venular branching angle, venular branching asymmetry ratio and OAW were not related to blood pressure. Retinal arteriolar caliber (sβ = -0.277) and FAN (sβ = 0.170) had the strongest associations with mean arterial blood pressure, and higher blood pressure levels were associated with increasing number of both quantitative and qualitative retinal vascular signs (P trend <0.001). CONCLUSION: Elevated blood pressure is associated with a spectrum of quantitative and qualitative retinal vascular signs, with the number of signs increasing with higher blood pressure levels.
21593293	Retinal vascular geometry predicts incident retinopathy in young people with type 1 diabetes: a prospective cohort study from adolescence.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between retinal vascular geometry and subsequent development of incident retinopathy in young patients with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 736 people with type 1 diabetes aged 12 to 20 years, retinopathy-free at baseline, attending an Australian tertiary care hospital. Retinopathy was determined from seven-field retinal photographs according to the modified Airlie House Classification. Retinal vascular geometry, including length/diameter ratio (LDR) and simple tortuosity (ST), was quantified in baseline retinal photographs. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine risk of retinopathy associated with baseline LDR and ST, adjusting for other factors. RESULTS: After a median 3.8 (interquartile range 2.4-6.1) years of follow-up, incident retinopathy developed in 287 of 736 (39%). In multivariate analysis, lower arteriolar LDR (odds ratio 1.8 [95% CI 1.2-2.6]; 1st vs. 4th quartile) and greater arteriolar ST (1.5 [1.0-2.2]; 4th vs. 1st quartile) predicted incident retinopathy after adjusting for diabetes duration, sex, A1C, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and BMI. In subgroup analysis by sex, LDR predicted incident retinopathy in male and female participants (2.1 [1.1-4.0] and 1.7 [1.1-2.7]; 1st vs. 4th quartiles, respectively) and greater arteriolar ST predicted incident retinopathy in male participants (2.4 [1.1-4.4]; 4th vs. 1st quartile) only. CONCLUSIONS: Lower arteriolar LDR and greater ST were independently associated with incident retinopathy in young people with type 1 diabetes. These vascular geometry measures may serve as risk markers for diabetic retinopathy and provide insights into the early structural changes in diabetic microvascular complications.
22088792	Retinal microvascular calibre and risk of incident diabetes: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis.	AIM: To prospectively examine the association of retinal microvascular signs with incident diabetes and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in a multi-ethnic population-based cohort. METHODS: The multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis comprised Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics and Chinese aged 45-84 years. Retinal vascular calibre and retinopathy were quantified from baseline retinal photographs. Incident diabetes and IFG were ascertained prospectively. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 3 years, 243 (4.9%) people developed diabetes and 565 (15.0%) developed IFG. After adjusting for known risk factors, participants with wider retinal arteriolar calibre had a higher risk of developing diabetes [HR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.12-2.29, p=0.011 comparing highest with lowest arteriolar calibre tertile]. In ethnic subgroup analysis, the association between wider retinal arteriolar calibre and incident diabetes was stronger and statistically significant only in Caucasians [HR: 2.78; 95% CI: 1.37-5.62, p=0.005]. Retinal venular calibre and retinopathy signs were not related to risk of diabetes or IFG. CONCLUSION: Wider retinal arteriolar calibre is independently associated with an increased risk of diabetes, supporting a possible role for early arteriolar changes in diabetes development. This effect was largely seen in Caucasians, and not in other ethnic groups, and may reflect ethnic differences in susceptibility to diabetes from microvascular pathways.
22517193	Retinal vascular calibre, geometry and progression of diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus.	PURPOSE: To determine whether changes in retinal vascular calibre and geometry are associated with progression of diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes (T2D). PROCEDURES: The retinal vascular calibre and geometry of 30 subjects with more than 20 years of diagnosed T2D with no retinopathy (NR) were compared to 30 subjects that progressed to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The images of PDR subjects included in this study were those obtained before the onset of retinopathy. The diameter of retinal arterioles (CRAE), retinal venules (CRVE), tortuosity of retinal vessels, junctional exponent deviation (JE(a)) and fractal dimension (D(f)) were measured using Singapore I Vessel Assessment (SIVA 3.0) software and compared using Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: The median CRAE and the median CRVE were significantly wider in PDR subjects compared to NR subjects (p = 0.014 and 0.016), respectively. Curvature tortuosity of the retinal arteries and veins and D(f) were significantly decreased in the PDR subjects compared to NR subjects (p = 0.015, 0.016 and 0.03, respectively). The JE(a) was significantly increased in PDR subjects (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Retinal vessel calibre and geometry of the retinal vasculature may be important risk factors for the progression to PDR. More longitudinal prospective studies will be needed to further explore the findings of this study.
22922377	Retinal microvascular signs are associated with chronic kidney disease in persons with and without diabetes.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: In persons with diabetes, retinal microvascular abnormalities are associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, it is not clear if the same relationship applies in persons without diabetes. METHODS: We examined 2,971 participants from a population-based study (240 with, 2,731 without diabetes). Retinal photographs were masked graded for retinal microvascular signs, and CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR(MDRD)) <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). RESULTS: Retinal microvascular signs were more frequent in persons with CKD. After adjusting for age, gender, systolic blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose, CKD was associated with both presence of retinopathy (odds ratio, OR, 1.2, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.0-1.5) and venular dilation (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.5). These associations were similar in persons with and without diabetes. There was a significant trend for increasing magnitude of associations of retinopathy with increasing severity levels of CKD (p for trend 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Retinal microvascular signs, namely retinopathy lesions and venular dilation, are associated with CKD both in persons with, and without diabetes. This supports the concept that retinal microvascular signs are indicators of generalized microvascular disease even in the absence of diabetes, and reinforces the link between retinal and renal microcirculations.
23204249	Relationship between retinal blood flow and renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.	OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between retinal microcirculation and renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a laser Doppler velocimetry system, we obtained the retinal blood flow (RBF) values by simultaneously measuring the retinal vessel diameter and blood velocity. To determine if the RBF is affected in the presence of renal dysfunction, we also evaluated the renal function using the estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated by age and serum creatinine level. RESULTS: We recruited 169 eyes of 169 consecutive Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, no or minimal diabetic retinopathy, and normo/microalbuminuria (mean age ± SD, 59.0 ± 11.1 years). We divided the patients into four groups based on the stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (non-CKD, n = 99; CKD stage 1, n = 22; stage 2, n = 27; stage 3, n = 21). We found significant (P = 0.035) decreases in RBF with decreased vessel diameter (P = 0.017) but no difference in blood velocity (P = 0.54) in stage 3 CKD compared with the non-CKD group. Multiple regression analysis showed that the CKD stage was significantly (P = 0.02) and independently associated with decreased RBF. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the vessel diameter and RBF in the retinal arterioles decrease in patients with type 2 diabetes with stage 3 CKD, suggesting that impaired renal function might be associated with decreased RBF, probably via constriction of the retinal arterioles, in early-phase diabetic retinopathy.
23572105	Structural changes in the retinal microvasculature and renal function.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the associations between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and microalbuminuria, and a comprehensive range of retinal microvascular abnormalities including traditional and new retinal vascular measures. METHODS: This was a population-based, cross-sectional study on 3280 urban Malay adults. The albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) was calculated from spot urine samples. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated from serum creatinine concentration. Retinal vascular caliber and geometry were quantified from retinal fundus photographs using a semiautomated computer-assisted program. Qualitative changes including focal arteriolar narrowing, arteriovenous nicking, and opacification of the arteriolar wall were assessed by trained graders. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, narrower retinal arteriolar caliber (P = 0.008), smaller retinal vascular fractal dimensions (P = 0.014), and the presence of AV nicking and opacification (P = 0.005 and P < 0.001, respectively) were significantly associated with lower eGFR. In multivariate adjusted logistic regression analyses, none of the retinal markers was associated with CKD. A smaller fractal dimension (P < 0.001) and the presence of focal arteriolar narrowing, AV nicking and opacification were associated with higher ACR (P < 0.001, P = 0.01, and P = 0.002, respectively). Narrower retinal arterioles (P = 0.041); smaller fractal dimensions (P = 0.006); and focal arteriolar narrowing, AV nicking, and opacification (P = 0.007, P = 0.007, and P = 0.012, respectively) were associated with higher likelihoods of having microalbuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative changes of the retinal vascular geometry and qualitative changes in the vessel architecture are associated with markers of renal dysfunction and damage.
23715958	Microvascular structure and network in the retina of patients with ischemic stroke.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Microvascular disease has been implicated in the pathogenesis of stroke. The retina provides a window to assess microcirculation noninvasively. We studied the association between quantitatively measured retinal microvascular characteristics and acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study with acute ischemic stroke patients recruited from a tertiary hospital in Singapore and controls from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Disease program matched by 10-year age strata, sex, and race. Strokes were classified using modified Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria. Retinal vascular parameters were measured from retinal fundus photographs using a computer program. Logistic regression models for stroke were constructed adjusting for age, sex, race, and additionally for smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. RESULTS: We included 557 ischemic stroke cases (261 lacunar, 185 large artery, and 54 cardioembolic stroke) and 557 controls. After adjusting for vascular risk factors, decreased arteriolar fractal dimension (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation [SD] decrease, 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80-2.87) and venular fractal dimension (OR per SD decrease, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.46-2.23), increased arteriolar tortuosity (OR per SD increase, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.25-1.95), and venular tortuosity (OR per SD increase, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.27-1.76), narrower arteriolar caliber (OR per SD decrease, 2.79; 95% CI, 2.21-3.53), and wider venular caliber (OR per SD increase, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.27-1.95) were associated with stroke. Stratification by stroke subtypes and further adjustment for retinopathy signs revealed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ischemic stroke have a sparser and more tortuous microvascular network in the retina. These findings provide insight into the structure and pattern of microcirculation changes in stroke.
23868266	Retinal microvascular changes and risk of stroke: the Singapore Malay Eye Study.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between retinal microvascular measures and incident stroke in an Asian Malay population. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, population-based cohort study of Asian Malay persons 40 to 80 years at baseline. Retinal microvascular signs were assessed from baseline retinal photographs including quantitative retinal microvascular parameters (caliber, branching angle, tortuosity, and fractal dimension) and qualitative retinopathy signs. Incident stroke cases were identified during the follow-up period. Cox proportional-hazards regression and incremental usefulness analysis (calibration, discrimination, and reclassification) were performed. RESULTS: A total of 3189 participants were free of prevalent stroke at baseline. During the follow-up (median, 4.41 years), 51 (1.93%) participants had an incident stroke event. In Cox proportional-hazards models adjusting for established stroke predictors (age, sex, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, glycosylated hemoglobin, and antihypertensive medication), retinopathy (hazard ratio, 1.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-3.72) and larger retinal venular caliber (hazard ratio, 3.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-8.26, comparing fourth versus first quartiles) were associated with risk of stroke. Compared with the model with only established risk factors, the addition of retinal measures improved the prediction of stroke (C-Statistic 0.826 versus 0.792; P=0.017) and correctly reclassified 5.9% of participants with incident stroke and 3.4% of participants with no incident stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal microvascular changes are related to an increased risk of stroke in Asian Malay, consistent with data from white populations. Retinal imaging improves the discrimination and stratification of stroke risk beyond that of established risk factors by a significant but small margin.
24981770	Retinal vascular fractals predict long-term microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes mellitus: the Danish Cohort of Pediatric Diabetes 1987 (DCPD1987).	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Fractal analysis of the retinal vasculature provides a global measure of the complexity and density of retinal vessels summarised as a single variable: the fractal dimension. We investigated fractal dimensions as long-term predictors of microvasculopathy in type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We included 180 patients with type 1 diabetes in a 16 year follow-up study. In baseline retinal photographs (from 1995), all vessels in a zone 0.5-2.0 disc diameters from the disc margin were traced using Singapore Institute Vessel Assessment-Fractal image analysis software. Artefacts were removed by a certified grader, and fractal dimensions were calculated using the box-counting method. At follow-up (in 2011), diabetic neuropathy, nephropathy and proliferative retinopathy were assessed and related to baseline fractal dimensions in multiple regressions adjusted for sex and baseline age, diabetes duration, HbA1c, BP, BMI, vibration perception threshold, albuminuria, retinopathy and vessel diameters. RESULTS: Mean baseline age and diabetes duration were 21.0 and 13.4 years, respectively, and of patients 50.0% were males. The mean fractal dimension was 1.3817. The 16 year incidences of neuropathy, nephropathy and proliferative retinopathy were 10.8%, 8.0% and 27.9%, respectively. Multiple regression analyses showed a lower fractal dimension to significantly predict incident neuropathy (OR 1.17 per 0.01 fractal dimension decrease [95% CI 1.01, 1.36]), nephropathy (OR 1.40 per 0.01 fractal dimension decrease [95% CI 1.10, 1.79]) and proliferative retinopathy (OR 1.22 per 0.01 fractal dimension decrease [95% CI 1.09, 1.37]). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The retinal vascular fractal dimension is a shared biomarker of diabetic microvasculopathy, thus indicating a possible common pathogenic pathway. Retinal fractal analysis therefore is a potential tool for risk stratification in type 1 diabetes.
25613127	Diabetic macular ischaemia is associated with narrower retinal arterioles in patients with type 2 diabetes.	PURPOSE: Diabetic macular ischaemia (DMI) is an important cause of visual loss in patients with diabetes, but its relationship to the larger retinal vessels is unknown. We examined whether retinal vessel calibre is related to DMI. METHODS: Clinic-based case-control study of patients with type 2 diabetes. The presence and severity of DMI was assessed using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocols from fundus fluorescein angiographic (FFA) images. Custom software was used to quantify the greatest linear dimension and area of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ). Retinal vessel calibre was measured using a semi-automated software on fundus fluorescein images. RESULTS: Of 53 patients examined, 18 (34%), 18 (34%) and 17 (32%) had no/mild, moderate and severe DMI, respectively. Persons with moderate or severe DMI had narrower mean retinal arteriolar calibre than persons with no/mild DMI (140.6 μm 95% confidence interval (CI) 134.7, 146.4 versus 150.7 μm, 95% CI 142.5, 158, p = 0.04). The association remained after multivariate adjustment for age, gender, previous panretinal photocoagulation, neovascularization at the disc and elsewhere and diabetic retinopathy severity. Increased FAZ size was also associated with narrower arteriolar calibre. Retinal venular calibre and arteriole to venule ratio (AVR) were not associated with DMI. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal arteriolar narrowing was associated with moderate-to-severe macular ischaemia in eyes with diabetic retinopathy. This suggests that larger vessels other than capillaries may also be associated with DMI.
25658337	Retinal microvascular abnormalities and risk of renal failure in Asian populations.	BACKGROUND: Retinal microvascular signs may provide insights into the structure and function of small vessels that are associated with renal disease. We examined the relationship of retinal microvascular signs with both prevalent and incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in a multi-ethnic Asian population. METHODS: A total of 5763 subjects (aged ≥ 40 years) from two prospective population-based studies (the Singapore Malay Eye Study and the Singapore Prospective Study) were included for the current analysis. Retinopathy was graded using the modified Airlie House classification system. Retinal vascular parameters were measured using computer-assisted programs to quantify the retinal vessel widths (arteriolar and venular caliber) and retinal vascular network (fractal dimension). Data on ESRD was obtained by record linkage with the ESRD cases registered by National Registry of Diseases Office, Singapore. Multi-variable adjusted regression analyses were performed to assess the associations of baseline retinal vascular parameters and prevalent and incident ESRD. RESULTS: At baseline, 21(0.36%) persons had prevalent ESRD. During a median follow-up of 4.3 years, 33 (0.57%) subjects developed ESRD. In our analyses, retinopathy was associated with prevalent ESRD (multi-variable adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-8.05) and incident ESRD (multi-variable adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.51, 95%CI: 1.14-5.54). This association was largely seen in person with diabetes (HR, 2.60, 95%CI: 1.01-6.66) and not present in persons without diabetes (HR, 1.65, 95%CI: 0.14-18.98). Retinal arteriolar caliber, retinal venular caliber and retinal vascular fractal dimension were not associated with ESRD. CONCLUSION: Retinopathy signs in persons with diabetes are related to an increased risk of ESRD; however, other microvascular changes in the retina are not associated with ESRD.
26086266	Retinal Vessel Tortuosity and Its Relation to Traditional and Novel Vascular Risk Markers in Persons with Diabetes.	PURPOSE/AIM: To investigate the association between retinal vascular tortuosity and traditional- and vascular-related risk factors in persons with diabetes. METHODS: We recruited 224 diabetic patients. Retinal vascular tortuosity was measured from fundus photographs. Association of tortuosity with the following factors was assessed after adjusting for significant co-factors: diabetes duration, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure (SBP), cholesterol and body mass index (BMI), flicker-light induced retinal vasodilatation, and markers of endothelial function and inflammation (skin microvacular responses to acetylcholine iontophoresis, soluble e-selectin, inter-cellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, endothelin-1, total nitrite, C-reactive protein). RESULTS: Adjusting for age and gender, longer diabetes duration was associated with more tortuous retinal arterioles (mean difference in arteriolar tortuosity 5.85 × 10(-5), 95% Confidence Interval 1.44-10.3 × 10(-5); p = 0.016; ≤10 versus >10 years duration). Reduced flicker-light induced retinal vasodilatation was associated with tortuous arterioles and venules (mean difference in arteriolar tortuosity 5.62 × 10(-5), 4.50-6.72 × 10(-5); p < 0.001 and in venules 5.94 × 10(-5), 3.33-8.55 × 10(-5); p < 0.001; comparing highest versus lowest tertile of flicker-light vasodilatation). These associations remained after adjusting for co-factors. Diabetes duration explained about 36% and flicker-light vasodilatation 25% of the variation in retinal arteriolar tortuosity. No associations were found between retinal arteriolar or venular tortuosity and HBA1c, SBP, cholesterol, BMI and serum markers of endothelial function. CONCLUSIONS: Increased retinal arteriolar tortuosity was related to longer diabetes duration and reduced flicker-light induced vasodilatory response, suggesting that retinal vascular tortuosity in adults with diabetes may be influenced by multiple diabetes-related physio-pathological changes.
26232097	Retinal microvascular calibre and risk of diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and participant-level meta-analysis.	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The calibre of the retinal vessels has been linked to diabetes mellitus but studies have not shown consistent results. We conducted a participant-level meta-analysis to evaluate the association between retinal arteriolar and venular calibre and diabetes. METHODS: We performed a systematic review on MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles published up to December 2014. We identified five population-based prospective cohort studies that provided individual-level data on 18,771 diabetes-free participants. We used discrete time proportional hazards models to estimate pooled HRs of diabetes associated with 1 SD (20 μm) change in retinal vascular calibre. RESULTS: We identified 2,581 incident cases of diabetes over a median follow-up period of 10 years (interquartile interval of 3.4-15.8 years). After adjustment for demographic, lifestyle and clinical factors, retinal venular calibre was significantly associated with incident diabetes (pooled HR 1.09 [95% CI 1.02, 1.15] per SD increase in venular calibre). This association persisted in analyses excluding individuals with <5 years of follow-up (1.07 [1.0, 1.12]) or those with impaired fasting glucose at baseline (1.10 [1.03, 1.17]); in subgroup analyses, the association was stronger in men than in women but was consistent across subgroups of race/ethnicity, smoking status, hypertension and BMI categories. Retinal arteriolar calibre was not associated with diabetes (0.95 [0.86, 1.06] per SD decrease in arteriolar calibre). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Wider retinal venules but not narrower retinal arterioles were associated with a modestly increased risk for diabetes. Knowledge of pathological mechanisms underlying wider retinal venule may provide further insights concerning microvascular alterations in diabetes.
26531050	Metabolic syndrome and retinal microvascular calibre in a high cardiovascular disease risk cohort.	AIMS: To investigate the independent associations between metabolic syndrome and retinal vessel calibre in a high cardiovascular risk cohort, and to determine whether these associations also exist in patients without diabetes, hypertension or coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: The Australian Heart Eye Study is an observational study that surveyed 1680 participants who presented to a tertiary referral hospital for the evaluation of potential CAD by coronary angiography. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program. Retinal arteriolar calibre narrowing and retinal venular calibre widening were measured from retinal photographs. CAD was quantified using severity (Gensini) and extent scores. Diabetes and hypertension were defined from clinical investigation (fasting plasma glucose >7.0 mmol/L and blood pressure >130/85 mm Hg) or from self-reported clinical diagnosis, including the use of medications. RESULTS: A total of 979 participants had complete information on metabolic syndrome components and were included in cross-sectional analyses. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking status and fellow vessel calibre, persons with metabolic syndrome (compared with persons without metabolic syndrome) had narrower retinal arteriolar calibre (mean difference 4.3 µm, p<0.0001). No significant difference in venular calibre was observed (p=0.05). This association persisted in persons without diabetes (mean arteriolar calibre difference 4.4 µm, p=0.0006) but not in participants without CAD and those without hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic syndrome is independently associated with narrower retinal arterioles but not wider retinal venules among those at high risk of CAD. The association between metabolic syndrome and narrower retinal arterioles is likely due to the presence of CAD or hypertension in individuals with this syndrome, as the association is not significant in individuals without hypertension or without CAD.
26656332	Retinal Vessel Diameter and Chronic Kidney Disease in Rural China: A Cross-Sectional Study.	Few studies have examined the relationship between retinal microvascular abnormalities and chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aims to examine the association between retinal vessel diameters and CKD in the rural China in order to provide the scientific basis for the early detection and diagnosis for CKD.Participants and data were extracted from the Handan Eye Study, a population-based cross-sectional study performed from 2006 to 2007. The central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE) and central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE) were summarized by the average arteriolar and venular caliber of each eye. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and a urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine any associations between CRAE, CRVE, arteriole-to-venule ratio (AVR), retinopathy, and CKD in the recruited participants.CKD was found in was 17.3% (892/5158) of this population with a 0.9% (48/5545) rate of reduced renal function and 16.7% (922/5538) rate of albuminuria. Retinopathy was present in 9.6% (571/5925) of participants. Compared to the 4th quartile of AVR, the first group was found to have a higher risk of albuminuria (odds ratio [OR] = 1.261, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.015-1.567, P = 0.037) and CKD (OR = 1.240, 95%CI: 1.000-1.537, P = 0.049) after adjustment for potential confounding variables. Retinopathy was associated with the occurrence of albuminuria (OR = 1.340, 95%CI: 1.067-1.685, P = 0.012) and CKD (OR = 1.341, 95%CI: 1.071-1.681, P = 0.010). In participants with diabetes, the ORs for the 1st and 4th quartiles of CRAE and CRVE were 2.292 (95%CI: 1.076-4.881, P = 0.032) and 2.113 (95%CI: 1.006-4.438, P = 0.048), respectively. Among the participants with hypertension, retinopathy was also observed to be associated with CKD (OR = 1.306, 95%CI: 1.003-1.699, P = 0.047).The parameters of retinal vessel diameter may be a useful index evaluating the occurrence and development of CKD.
26659133	Association between Retinal Arteriolar and Venule Calibre with Prevalent Heart Failure: A Cross-Sectional Study.	BACKGROUND: There is evidence to suggest that microvascular disease, particularly diabetic retinopathy, plays a role in the pathogenesis of HF. However, whether changes in retinal vessel calibre predicts HF is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of retinal microvascular structure with prevalent heart failure (HF). METHODS: The Australian Heart Eye Study (AHES) is a cross-sectional study that surveyed 1680 participants who presented to a tertiary referral hospital for the evaluation of potential coronary artery disease by coronary angiography. Retinal vessel calibre was graded using retinal photography and participants' self-reported echocardiography-confirmed HF was obtained via an extensive medical questionnaire. RESULTS: There were 107 participants (8.1%) with prevalent self-reported HF. Persons with wider retinal arteriolar calibre (comparing highest versus lowest tertile or reference) were more likely to have prevalent HF (OR 3.5; 95% CI, 1.7-7.2) when adjusted for age and sex. After further adjustment for body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, triglycerides and estimated glomerular filtration rate, this association remained significant (OR 4.5; 95% CI, 2.0-9.8). After further stratification, this association remained significant among participants with diabetes (OR 10.3; 95% CI, 2.7-39.3) but not in those without diabetes (OR 2.7; 95% CI, 0.9-7.5). The strength of this association was not dependent on the length of history of diabetes, or retinopathy status. There was no significant association between retinal venular calibre and prevalence of HF. CONCLUSIONS: Wider retinal arteriolar diameter was significantly and independently associated with prevalent HF in participants of a cross-sectional study. This association was significant stronger among participants with diabetes compared to without diabetes. No association was found between retinal venule calibre with prevalent HF.
26771382	Associations between Retinal Markers of Microvascular Disease and Cognitive Impairment in Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Case Control Study.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between retinal microvascular changes and cognitive impairment in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. DESIGN: Case control study. SETTING: A primary care cohort with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: For this analysis, we compared 69 cases with lowest decile scores (for the cohort) on the Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status and 68 controls randomly selected from the remainder of the cohort. Retinal images were rated and the following measures compared between cases and controls: retinal vessel calibre, arterio-venous ratio, retinal fractal dimension, and simple and curvature retinal vessel tortuosity. RESULTS: Total and venular (but not arteriolar) simple retinal vessel tortuosity levels were significantly higher in cases than controls (t = 2.45, p = 0.015; t = 2.53, p = 0.013 respectively). The associations persisted after adjustment for demographic factors, retinopathy, neuropathy, obesity and blood pressure. There were no other significant differences between cases and controls in retinal measures. CONCLUSIONS: A novel association was found between higher venular tortuosity and cognitive impairment in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. This might be accounted for by factors such as hypoxia, thrombus formation, increased vasoendothelial growth factor release and inflammation affecting both the visible retinal and the unobserved cerebral microvasculature.
27012863	Inter-arm Blood Pressure Difference and its Relationship with Retinal Microvascular Calibres in Young Individuals: The African-PREDICT Study.	BACKGROUND: Bilateral systolic blood pressure (SBP) differences > 10mmHg is a common finding in clinical practice. Such BP differences in older individuals are associated with peripheral vascular disease, linked to microvascular dysfunction. Investigating retinal vessel calibres could provide insight into systemic microvascular function and may predict cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore we investigated the link between inter-arm systolic blood pressure differences (IASBPD) and the retinal microvasculature to determine the usefulness of IASBPD as an early marker of microvascular changes. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used data from 403 apparently healthy participants (20-30 years) (42% men; 49% black) taking part in the African-PREDICT study. Participants underwent retinal vessel imaging, anthropometric measurements and blood sampling. Brachial BP was measured sequentially in both arms to determine the mean IASBPD. RESULTS: Participants were stratified into two groups with an IASBPD < 10mmHg (n=329) and ≥ 10mmHg (n=47), the only difference in characteristics being a higher right arm SBP in the latter group (p=0.005). We found no association between IASBPD and retinal vessel calibres in any group. Less than 2% of the variance in IASBPD was explained by potential risk factors, with only SBP associating independently with IASBPD (β=115; p=0.039). CONCLUSION: In a young population an increased IASBPD is not related to retinal vessel diameters suggesting that it does not reflect early microvascular alterations.
27056406	Associations of blood pressure variability and retinal arteriolar diameter in participants with type 2 diabetes.	Blood pressure variability is associated with macrovascular complications and stroke, but its association with the microcirculation in type II diabetes has not been assessed. This study aimed to determine the relationship between blood pressure variability indices and retinal arteriolar diameter in non-diabetic and type II diabetes participants. Digitized retinal images were analysed to quantify arteriolar diameters in 35 non-diabetic (aged 52 ± 11 years; 49% male) and 28 type II diabetes (aged 61 ± 9 years; 50% male) participants. Blood pressure variability was derived from 24-h ambulatory blood pressure. Arteriolar diameter was positively associated with daytime rate of systolic blood pressure variation (p = 0.04) among type II diabetes participants and negatively among non-diabetics (p = 0.008; interaction p = 0.001). This finding was maintained after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and mean daytime systolic blood pressure. These findings suggest that the blood pressure variability-related mechanisms underlying retinal vascular disease may differ between people with and without type II diabetes.
27396240	Patients with type 2 diabetes having higher glomerular filtration rate showed rapid renal function decline followed by impaired glomerular filtration rate: Japan Diabetes Complications Study.	AIMS: The Japan Diabetes Complications Study (JDCS), a nation-wide, multicenter, prospective study of patients with type 2 diabetes, reported that hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure, and smoking were risk factors for the onset of macroalbuminuria. This study explored the risk factors for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in the JDCS patients. METHODS: We examined the 1407 JDCS patients (667 women, mean age 59years, 974 normoalbuminuria, 433 microalbuminuria) whose urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and estimated GFR (eGFR) were determined at baseline with an 8-year follow-up. We divided all the patients into four groups according to baseline eGFR: G1 (120≤eGFR), G2 (90≤eGFR<120), G3 (60≤eGFR<90), G4 (eGFR<60). RESULTS: The eGFRs in groups G1 and G2 decreased at follow-up compared to those at the baseline. The risk of annual eGFR decline rate≥3ml/min/1.73m2 (rapid decliners) increased as the baseline eGFR increased. Advanced age, high HbA1c, and UACR, or diabetic retinopathy at baseline were risk factors for the rapid decliners. Especially the G1 group had a significant risk for the rapid decliners. The frequency of the patients with GFR<60ml/min/1.73m2 at the follow-up amounted to 31.1% in the rapid decliners, which was higher than 12% in the non-rapid decliners. CONCLUSIONS: In normo- and microalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes, extra careful attention should be paid to patients with eGFR ≥120ml/min/1.73m2 to detect cases with rapidly decreased GFR under the normal range.
27520462	Retinal vascular geometry and its association to microvascular complications in patients with type 1 diabetes: the Danish Cohort of Pediatric Diabetes 1987 (DCPD1987).	PURPOSE: To examine associations between retinal vascular geometry (tortuosity, branching coefficient [BC] and length-diameter ratio [LDR]) and diabetic proliferative retinopathy (PDR), nephropathy, and peripheral neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). METHODS: A cohort of patients with T1DM participated in a clinical examination in 2011. Blood and urine analyses were done and retinal images taken. PDR was defined as Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study level 61 or above, nephropathy as albumin-creatinin ratio ≥300 mg/g, and neuropathy as vibration perception threshold >25 Volt. Retinal vessel parameters were measured using semi-automated software. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to investigate correlations between retinal vascular parameters and outcomes. Models were adjusted for other variables (sex, age, duration of diabetes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c, and presence of microvascular complications). Odds ratios were given per standard deviation in retinal vascular parameter. RESULTS: Retinal vascular analyses were performed in 181 patients. Mean age and duration of diabetes were 37.0 years and 29.4 years respectively, and 50.8% were male. Prevalence of PDR, nephropathy, and neuropathy were 26.5%, 6.8%, and 10.1% , respectively. Patients with increased arteriolar BC had a higher risk of nephropathy (OR: 3.10, 95% CI: [1.01-9.54]). Patients with increased venular BC had a higher risk of neuropathy (OR: 2.11, 95% CI: [1.11-4.03]). No associations were found in patients with PDR. CONCLUSIONS: By analyzing the retinal vascular tree in patients with T1DM, we found a higher risk of complications in kidneys and nerves when BC was increased. This might indicate a suboptimal construction of the vascular tree in these patients.
27678264	Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Are Associated With Generalized Microvascular Dysfunction: The Maastricht Study.	BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This can be partly explained by large-artery dysfunction, which already occurs in prediabetes ("ticking clock hypothesis"). Whether a similar phenomenon also applies to microvascular dysfunction is not known. We therefore tested the hypothesis that microvascular dysfunction is already present in prediabetes and is more severe in T2DM. To do so, we investigated the associations of prediabetes, T2DM, and measures of hyperglycemia with microvascular function measured as flicker light-induced retinal arteriolar dilation and heat-induced skin hyperemia. METHODS: In the Maastricht Study, a T2DM-enriched population-based cohort study (n=2213, 51% men, aged [mean±standard deviation] 59.7±8.2 years), we determined flicker light-induced retinal arteriolar %-dilation (Dynamic Vessel Analyzer), heat-induced skin %-hyperemia (laser-Doppler flowmetry), and glucose metabolism status (oral glucose tolerance test; normal glucose metabolism [n=1269], prediabetes [n=335], or T2DM [n=609]). Differences were assessed with multivariable regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, systolic blood pressure, lipid profile, retinopathy, estimated glomerular filtration rate, (micro)albuminuria, the use of lipid-modifying and blood pressure-lowering medication, and prior cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: Retinal arteriolar %-dilation was (mean±standard deviation) 3.4±2.8 in normal glucose metabolism, 3.0±2.7 in prediabetes, and 2.3±2.6 in T2DM. Adjusted analyses showed a lower arteriolar %-dilation in prediabetes (B=-0.20, 95% confidence interval -0.56 to 0.15) with further deterioration in T2DM (B=-0.61 [-0.97 to -0.25]) versus normal glucose metabolism (P for trend=0.001). Skin %-hyperemia was (mean±standard deviation) 1235±810 in normal glucose metabolism, 1109±748 in prediabetes, and 937±683 in T2DM. Adjusted analyses showed a lower %-hyperemia in prediabetes (B=-46 [-163 to 72]) with further deterioration in T2DM (B=-184 [-297 to -71]) versus normal glucose metabolism (P for trend=0.001). In addition, higher glycohemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma glucose were associated with lower retinal arteriolar %-dilation and skin %-hyperemia in fully adjusted models (for glycohemoglobin A1c, standardized B=-0.10 [-0.15 to -0.05], P<0.001 and standardized B=-0.13 [-0.19 to -0.07], P<0.001, respectively; for fasting plasma glucose, standardized B=-0.09 [-0.15 to -0.04], P<0.001 and standardized B=-0.10 [-0.15 to -0.04], P=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: Prediabetes, T2DM, and measures of hyperglycemia are independently associated with impaired microvascular function in the retina and skin. These findings support the concept that microvascular dysfunction precedes and thus may contribute to T2DM-associated cardiovascular disease and other complications, which may in part have a microvascular origin such as impaired cognition and heart failure.
28222036	Vascular risk factors are associated with retinal arteriolar narrowing and venular widening in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.	BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to describe the relationship of retinal arteriolar and venular calibre with vascular risk factors in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: In this hospital-based cross-sectional study, the medical files of 483 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes were audited to collect retinal images and relevant clinical data. Retinal vascular calibre was measured using standardised protocols. RESULTS: After multivariable adjustments, a vascular risk profile that included: older age, higher serum creatinine, higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), higher body mass index (BMI), abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), lower high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol, longer duration of diabetes and higher serum sodium was associated with narrower central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE) (95% CI=-4.10/-0.76, p=0.004). A specific risk profile, including higher total cholesterol level, higher BMI, lower physical activity level, higher HbA1c, higher triglyceride levels, female gender and lower socio-economic status, was associated with wider central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE) (95% CI=1.14/5.62, p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these findings support evidence that cardiovascular disease may have its origins early in life. Prospective and/or intervention studies are required to confirm whether the observed associations are involved in the causal pathway for retinal vascular calibre.
28472211	Progressive Retinal Vasodilation in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes: A Longitudinal Study of Retinal Vascular Geometry.	Purpose: Retinal vessels can be used to noninvasively monitor changes in microvasculature. These changes in retinal vascular geometry (RVG) may predict chronic diabetes complications. We evaluated longitudinal RVG changes in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Methods: We followed 102 adolescents (baseline: 47.1% male, mean [SD] age 14.4 [1.6] years, diabetes duration 7.2 [3.1] years, HbA1c 8.1% [1.3%] [65 (9.3) mmol/mol]) over three visits, with a mean follow-up of 2.6 years. Retinal vascular geometry was measured using a standardized computer-assisted protocol from retinal photographs at each visit. Multivariable linear mixed-models and logistic regression were used to examine predictors of RVG and diabetic retinopathy. Results: During follow-up, mean arteriolar caliber, venular caliber, and venular tortuosity increased, from 156.0 (SD, 14.5) to 164.9 (14.0) μm, 215.9 (22.5) to 230.3 (20.6) μm, and 1.096 (0.014) to 1.099 (0.016), respectively (all P < 0.005). Other RVG measurements (fractal dimension, branching angle, length to diameter ratio) remained stable. Higher than baseline HbA1c and longer diabetes duration were associated with greater venular vasodilation. Retinopathy developed at any time-point in 24% of subjects, and the highest tertile arteriolar fractal dimension was associated with cumulative incidence of retinopathy (multivariable odds ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.0-9.6; P = 0.04). Conclusions: Higher HbA1c and longer diabetes duration in early adolescence predicts greater venular vasodilation over time. Arteriolar fractal dimension predicts subsequent retinopathy development, suggesting value as a potential biomarker for diabetic complications.
28615013	Short-term poor glycemic control and retinal microvascular changes in pediatric Type 1 Diabetes patients in Singapore: a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Poor glycemic control in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients is strongly associated with an increased risk of diabetes-related microvascular complications later in life, but it is unclear whether short period of poor glycemic control in children with T1D can cause evident microvascular morphological changes long before any pathological manifestation. Our study aimed to investigate the longitudinal association between poor glycemic control and subsequent changes in retinal microvasculature, in a pilot study of 55 pediatric T1D patients from Singapore after a one-year follow-up. METHODS: This is a hospital-based, exposure-matched and retrospective longitudinal study. A total of 55 T1D patients were included from Singapore KK Women's and Children Hospital, 28 of whom had poor glycemic control (average glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥8% during the year) while the other 27 age- and gender-matched subjects had good glycemic control (HbA1c <8%). Retinal photography was taken at diabetes annual screening and images were graded by trained graders using a semi-automated computer-based program (Singapore I Vessel Assessment [SIVA], version 4.0, Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore) and a spectrum of retinal vascular parameters (e.g. caliber, tortuosity, branching angle and fractal dimension) were measured quantitatively from 0.5 to 2.0 disc diameters. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in ethnicity, duration of T1D, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and low-density cholesterol lipoprotein (LDL) between the two groups. Retinal imaging was obtained at the end of 1 year of glycemic control assessment. In multiple linear regression adjusting for ethnicity, BMI, LDL and duration of T1D, patients with poor glycemic control tended to have marginally wider retinal arteriolar caliber (6.0 μm, 95% CI: -0.9, 12.8) and had significantly larger retinal arteriolar branching angle (10.1 degrees, 95% CI: 1.4, 18.9) compared with their age- and gender- matched counterparts with good glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that abnormal retinal microvascular morphology was evident in pediatric patients with T1D after one-year's poor glycemic control. Such morphological abnormalities may lead to future development of microvascular complications among T1D pediatric patients with poor glycemic control.
28623387	Retinal vascular geometry and 6 year incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy.	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to examine prospectively the association between a range of retinal vascular geometric variables measured from retinal photographs and the 6 year incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, population-based cohort study of Asian Malay individuals aged 40-80 years at baseline (n = 3280) who returned for a 6 year follow-up. Retinal vascular geometric variables (tortuosity, branching, fractal dimension, calibre) were measured from baseline retinal photographs using a computer-assisted program (Singapore I Vessel Assessment). Diabetic retinopathy was graded from baseline and follow-up photographs using the modified Airlie House classification system. Incidence of diabetic retinopathy was defined as a severity of ≥15 at follow-up among those without diabetic retinopathy at baseline. Incidence of referable diabetic retinopathy was defined as moderate or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular oedema at follow-up in participants who had had no or mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy at baseline. Progression of diabetic retinopathy was defined as an increase in severity of ≥2 steps at follow-up. Log-binomial models with an expectation-maximisation algorithm were used to estimate RR adjusting for age, sex, diabetes duration, HbA1c level, BP, BMI, estimated GFR and total and HDL-cholesterol at baseline. RESULTS: A total of 427 individuals with diabetes participated in the baseline and 6 year follow-up examinations. Of these, 19.2%, 7.57% and 19.2% developed incidence of diabetic retinopathy, incidence of referable diabetic retinopathy and diabetic retinopathy progression, respectively. After multivariate adjustment, greater arteriolar simple tortuosity (mean RR [95% CI], 1.34 [1.04, 1.74]), larger venular branching angle (RR 1.26 [1.00, 1.59]) and larger venular branching coefficient (RR 1.26 [1.03, 1.56]) were associated with incidence of diabetic retinopathy. Greater arteriolar simple tortuosity (RR 1.82 [1.32, 2.52]), larger venular branching coefficient (RR 1.46 [1.03, 2.07]), higher arteriolar fractal dimension (RR 1.59 [1.08, 2.36]) and larger arteriolar calibre (RR 1.83 [1.15, 2.90]) were associated with incidence of referable diabetic retinopathy. Greater arteriolar simple tortuosity (RR 1.34 [1.12, 1.61]) was associated with diabetic retinopathy progression. Addition of retinal vascular variables improved discrimination (C-statistic 0.796 vs 0.733, p = 0.031) and overall reclassification (net reclassification improvement 18.8%, p = 0.025) of any diabetic retinopathy risk beyond established risk factors. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Retinal vascular geometry measured from fundus photographs predicted the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy in adults with diabetes, beyond established risk factors.
