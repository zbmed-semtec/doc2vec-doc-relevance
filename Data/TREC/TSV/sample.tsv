9102202	Distinct somatic genetic changes associated with tumor progression in carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germ-line mutations.	BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations confer increased risk for development of breast cancer, but a number of additional, currently largely unknown, somatic genetic defects must also accumulate in the breast epithelial cells before malignancy develops. To evaluate the nature of these additional somatic genetic defects, we performed a genome-wide survey by comparative genomic hybridization on breast cancers from 21 BRCA1 mutation carriers, 15 BRCA2 mutation carriers, and 55 unselected controls. The total number of genetic changes was almost two times higher in tumors from both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers than in the control group. In BRCA1 tumors, losses of 5q (86%), 4q (81%), 4p (64%), 2q (40%), and 12q (40%) were significantly more common than in the control group (7-13%). BRCA2 tumors were characterized by a higher frequency of 13q (73%) and 6q (60%) losses and gains of 17q22-q24 (87%) and 20q13 (60%) as compared to the prevalence of these changes in the control group (12-18%). In conclusion, accumulation of somatic genetic changes during tumor progression may follow a unique pathway in individuals genetically predisposed to cancer, especially by the BRCA1 gene. Activation or loss of genes in the affected chromosomal regions may be selected for during tumor progression in cells lacking functional BRCA1 or BRCA2. Identification of such genes could provide targets for therapeutic intervention and early diagnosis.
9105560	Familial ligand-defective apolipoprotein B-100: detection, biochemical features and haplotype analysis of the R3531C mutation in the UK.	Familial ligand-defective apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 (FDB) is an autosomal codominant disorder which may give rise to hypercholesterolaemia. It is caused by the substitution of glutamine for arginine at codon 3500 of the apo B gene (apo B R3500Q), resulting in decreased binding of low density lipoprotein (LDL) to the LDL receptor. In order to search for other mutations in this region of the apo B gene, we have screened genomic DNA, obtained from 412 hypercholesterolaemic individuals, using heteroduplex analysis. Additional heteroduplex bands were observed following analysis of DNA from 11 individuals, nine of whom were heterozygous for apo B R3500Q. The two remaining individuals, both of Celtic origin, were shown by DNA sequencing to be heterozygous for a C-->T transition at nucleotide 10800 of the apo B gene, resulting in the substitution of cysteine for arginine at codon 3531 (apo B R3531C). Both had a strong family history of atherosclerosis and family studies revealed a further four individuals heterozygous for the mutation, three of whom were hypercholesterolaemic. Individuals heterozygous for apo B R3531C and R3500Q had mean +/- S.E.M. cholesterol concentrations of 7.82 +/- 0.68 and 8.53 +/- 0.31 mmol/l, respectively. These values were significantly higher than the value of 5.51 +/- 0.23 mmol/l observed in their unaffected relatives. These findings suggest that apo B R3531C is both less common in the UK and gives rise to a less severe form of hypercholesterolaemia than the classical 3500 mutation. In one of the families, the R3531C mutation occurred on a haplotype, compatible with that previously assigned to the mutation in a North American family also of Celtic origin. This is consistent with the mutation having been inherited from a common distant ancestor in individuals of Celtic origin.
9112375	Overexpression and activation of the insulin receptor enhances expression of ERCC-1 messenger ribonucleic acid in cultured cells.	In this study, a partial hamster complementary DNA encoding ERCC-1, a member of the DNA excision repair gene family, has been cloned. The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences were highly homologous to those of human and mouse ERCC-1. The hamster ERCC-1 gene was expressed as a 1.2-kilobase message in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed that overexpression of the insulin receptor or various growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases in Chinese hamster ovary cells increased ERCC-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. This effect did not occur in cells overexpressing mutated insulin receptors that are known to have impaired kinase-related signaling. Increased ERCC-1 expression correlated with resistance to UV exposure. Fluorescent-activated cell sorter analysis of confluent cell populations indicated no differences in cell cycle distribution. Furthermore, no significant relationship was demonstrated between the relative expression of ERCC-1 mRNA and the rate of glucose utilization. Insulin enhanced the accumulation of ERCC-1 mRNA in serum-deprived cells expressing wild-type insulin receptors. The potential role for activation of the insulin receptor and related growth factor receptors in ERCC-1 gene expression and function remains to be defined.
9112401	Up-regulation of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I hybrid receptors during differentiation of HT29-D4 human colonic carcinoma cells.	To assess the autocrine function of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) in the balance of proliferation and differentiation in HT29-D4 human colonic cancer cells, we studied the expression of IGF-I receptors (IGF-IR) and insulin receptors (IR) in relation to the state of cell differentiation. IGF-IR and IR were expressed in both undifferentiated and enterocyte-like differentiated HT29-D4 cells. IGF-IR had two isoforms with a 97-kDa and a 102-kDa beta-subunit. In addition, HT29-D4 cells expressed hybrid receptors (HR) formed by the association of two alphabeta heterodimers from both IR and IGF-IR. HR were evidenced through 1) inhibition of IGF-I binding by the B6 anti-IR antibody and 2) immunoprecipitation with the alpha-IR3 anti-IGF-IR antibody, which revealed an additional 95-kDa IR beta-subunit that disappeared when the heterotetrameric receptor was dissociated by disulfide reduction into alphabeta heterodimers before immunoprecipitation. Like IGF-IR, HR had a high affinity for IGF-I (Kd, approximately 1.5 nM), but did not bind insulin significantly; the latter interacted with the native IR only (Kd, approximately 4 nM). In the differentiated HT29-D4 cell monolayer, all receptor species were strongly polarized (>97%) toward the basolateral membrane. Moreover, HT29-D4 cell differentiation was accompanied by an approximately 2-fold increase in the number of IR, whereas the number of IGF-I-binding sites was unaltered. However, in differentiated HT29-D4 cells, approximately 55% of the latter were involved in HR vs. approximately 20% in undifferentiated HT29-D4 cells. Thus, HT29-D4 cell differentiation is characterized by an up-regulation (approximately 3-fold) of the level of HR coupled to a down-regulation (approximately 40%) of the level of native tetrameric IGF-IR. Alterations were induced early during the cell differentiation process, i.e. 5 days postconfluence, and remained unchanged for at least 21 days. Taken together, these results suggest that the IGF-II autocrine loop in HT29-D4 cells may trigger distinct signaling pathways if it activates native IGF-IR, which predominate in undifferentiated cells, or if it activates HR, which are up-regulated in differentiated cells.
9120013	RNA metabolism in myotonic dystrophy: patient muscle shows decreased insulin receptor RNA and protein consistent with abnormal insulin resistance.	Myotonic dystrophy is a dominantly inherited clinically variable multisystemic disorder, and has been found to be caused by heterozygosity for a trinucleotide repeat expansion mutation in the 3' untranslated region of a protein kinase gene (DM kinase). The mechanisms by which the expanded repeat in DNA results in a dominant biochemical defect and the varied clinical phenotype, is not known. We have recently proposed a model where disease pathogenesis may occur at the RNA level in myotonic dystrophy: the mutant DM kinase RNA with the expansion mutation may disrupt cellular RNA metabolism in some general manner, as evidenced by defects in RNA processing of the normal DM kinase gene in heterozygous patients (dominant negative RNA mutation). Here we further test this hypothesis by measuring RNA metabolism of other genes in patient muscle biopsies (nine adult onset myotonic dystrophy patients, two congenital muscular dystrophy patients, four normal controls, and four myopathic controls). We focused on the insulin receptor gene because of the documented insulin resistance of DM patients. We show that there is a significant decrease in insulin receptor RNA in both total RNA and RNA polyA+ pools relative to normal and myopathic control muscles (P < 0.002), measured relative to both dystrophin RNA and muscle sodium channel RNA. We also show reductions in insulin receptor protein. Our results reinforce the concept of a generalized RNA metabolism defect in myotonic dystrophy, and offer a possible molecular mechanism for the increased insulin resistance observed in many myotonic dystrophy patients.
9129722	No interaction between the APOE and the alpha-1-antichymotrypsin genes on risk for Alzheimer's disease.	It is now known that possession of one of the three common forms of the apolipoprotein E gene (allele epsilon 4) confers an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), both familial and sporadic, and that this risk is dose-dependent. Other genes that may play a role in AD, either through independent association with the disease or through modification of, or interaction with, the existing apolipoprotein E (APOE) risk, are now under investigation including the alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) gene, the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL-R) gene, and the presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene. Kamboh et al. [1995] reported that a polymorphism in the alpha-1-antichymotrypsin gene could modify the risk for AD conferred by the APOE locus, specifically by increasing the risk for AD among epsilon 4 homozygotes. The ACT gene, which is found on chromosome 14, has previously been proposed as a candidate for AD due to the presence of the ACT protein in senile plaques and the reported elevation of the protein in the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) and serum of AD cases. We have investigated this reported association within our familial and sporadic AD dataset, where we find no independent association between ACT and the occurrence of AD. Logistic regression analysis excludes ACT or the interaction between ACT and APOE as significant contributors in the prediction of disease status. By this analysis, ACT genotyping does not provide additional information about an individual's risk of Alzheimer's disease beyond the risk information conferred by APOE genotype alone.
9140076	Insulin-like growth factors control the regulation of oestrogen and progesterone receptor expression by oestrogens.	Ligands for the type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor interact with oestrogens to control the proliferation of oestrogen responsive breast cancer cells. The aim of this study was to determine the involvement of ligands for the type I IGF receptor in the regulation of oestrogen receptor (OR) expression by oestrogens and antioestrogens in these cells. Oestrogen decreased OR mRNA levels in MCF-7 cells whereas it increased them in T47D, EFM-19 and ZR-75 cells. In MCF-7 cells, IGF-I and insulin lowered further OR expression in the presence of oestrogen. In the presence of IGF-I or insulin, the induction of progesterone receptor mRNA by oestradiol was considerably attenuated in MCF-7 cells, showing that the enhanced down-regulation of OR mRNA levels influenced the expression of oestrogen-regulated genes. The oestrogen agonist activity of the antioestrogens tamoxifen and ICI 182 780 for the down-regulation of OR expression in MCF-7 cells was modulated by type I IGF receptor ligands. Overall these experiments show that OR expression is differentially regulated by oestrogen in individual oestrogen-responsive breast cancer cell lines. Ligands for the type I IGF receptor can modulate regulation of OR expression by oestrogens and antioestrogens principally in cells in which oestrogens down-regulate OR expression.
9142960	Insulin-like growth factors in breast cancer.	Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I is one of the most potent mitogens to many breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Effective growth inhibition in vitro may be achieved by antibodies to the type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR) or by using antisense strategies. Most human breast cancers express IGF-IR in vivo. Thus, different therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting ligand stimulation of the IGF-IR may be an attractive treatment option against breast cancer. Several drugs commonly used in breast cancer influence the IGF system both in vitro and in vivo. While antioestrogens such as tamoxifen and droloxifene reduce the expression of IGF-IR in vitro and suppress plasma levels of IGF-I but elevate IGF-binding protein-1 in vivo, megestrol acetate may reduce the delivery of IGFs to the tissues by inhibition of IGFBP-3 protease activity.
9157973	The insulin-like growth factor II receptor gene is mutated in genetically unstable cancers of the endometrium, stomach, and colorectum.	Disruption of the DNA mismatch repair system, characterized by microsatellite instability (MI), plays an important role in the course of human carcinogenesis. Repetitive sequences constitute targets for mutation in MI+ cells, and frequent mutations have indeed been reported in such regions within the transforming growth factor beta receptor II (RII) gene in genetically unstable colorectal and gastric cancers. However, other genes that are targets for mutations in MI+ cells during the course of carcinogenesis have proven elusive. Because the insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGFIIR) gene contains several repetitive sequences within its coding region, we examined mutations of this gene in MI+ cancers occurring at various primary sites. We found frameshift mutations in the poly(G)8 tract of IGFIIR in eight tumors, all of which were MI+: 4 of 26 (15%) MI+ endometrial cancers, 3 of 12 (25%) MI+ gastric cancers, and 1 of 18 (6%) MI+ colorectal cancers. In contrast, no mutation was found in 51 pancreatic cancers, 7 of which (14%) were MI+. These results implicate abnormal IGFIIR-mediated growth control in carcinogenesis involving the endometrium, stomach, and colorectum but not the pancreas.
9158141	Structure and sequence variation at the human leptin receptor gene in lean and obese Pima Indians.	The cloning of human and mouse cDNAs from brain that encode high affinity leptin receptors was recently reported. We have physically localized the human leptin receptor gene (LEPR) to a region at 1p31, between the anonymous microsatellite markers D1S515 and D1S198. The genomic structure of the human leptin receptor gene, corresponding to the published human brain cDNA sequence, spans over 70 kb and includes 20 exons. Since the leptin receptor gene is a candidate gene for obesity, and because of its proximity to D1S198, a marker previously linked to insulin secretion, the LEPR gene was sequenced in 20 non-diabetic Pima Indians chosen for extremes in percent body fat and in their acute insulin response to intravenous glucose. Seven polymorphic sites were identified. Two of these polymorphisms, Lys109Arg and Gln223Arg, are amino acid substitutions in the extracellular domain of the leptin receptor, one polymorphism is a silent substitution, and four occur in non-coding regions of the leptin receptor. Four of these sites are in linkage disequilibrium with one another. Nucleotides at three noncoding polymorphic sites were found exclusively in obese Pima Indians. This demonstrates an association between variation at the leptin receptor gene and obesity in humans.
9164825	Regulation of c-fos and c-jun expression by calcitonin in human breast cancer cells.	Breast cancer cells (BCC) have calcitonin (CT) receptors, yet the action of the hormone on these cells is largely unknown. We found that CT produced a strong and transient time- and dose-dependent increase in c-fos mRNA in BCC lines. This event was prevented by a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H89. CT alone did not influence the expression of c-jun and of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (timp) -1 and -2 mRNAs; however, it reduced the induction of these mRNAs by the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), without apparent changes in the half-life of the mRNA (measured for c-jun). Along the same line, CT reduced the c-jun induction and T-47D growth stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin. These effects were mimicked by forskolin and/or prevented by H89, suggesting that PKA activation was involved. These results indicate that CT modulates in BCC the mRNA levels of two important growth-related early response genes (c-fos and c-jun) and of two other genes (timp-1 and -2) involved in the control of metastatic events.
9175764	Defects of insulin and IGF-1 action at receptor and postreceptor level in a patient with type A syndrome of insulin resistance.	The action of insulin and IGF-1 in comparison to non-diabetic controls was studied in cultured fibroblasts of a patient with an inherited syndrome of insulin resistance (Type A syndrome). Insulin binding was reduced due to decreased receptor affinity, but sequence analyses revealed no alterations of splicing or primary insulin receptor (IR) structure. Most likely due to the IR affinity defect analyses of signal transduction pathways showed an impairment of insulin action on glucose uptake, total RNA synthesis and phosphorylation as well as activity of MAP-kinase. In addition inducibility of c-fos mRNA level was strongly impaired by insulin and IGF-1, but comparable to controls by PDGF indicating a postreceptor defect. In conclusion, we provide evidence that genetic syndromes of insulin resistance can be associated with both, receptor and postreceptor defects.
9179186	Gene therapy of prostate cancer: p53, suicidal genes, and other targets.	Prostate tumor initiation and progression to malignancy may involve upregulation of the androgen receptor known to stimulate prostate cell proliferation; other etiologic mechanisms may include dysfunction of the apoptotic pathway but also deregulation in signal transduction and control of the cell cycle in prostate tissue; such abnormalities could arise from overexpression or mutations in a number of oncogenes or down-regulation by inactivating mutations, allelic loss, or other epigenetic mechanisms in tumor suppressor genes. The advantages and drawbacks of various delivery systems (retroviral, adenoviral, liposomes) used for human gene therapy are being considered. Several ex vivo and in vivo as well as cell culture studies are suggested for the therapy of the human prostate cancer using transfer and expression of genes that might be implicated in prostate carcinogenesis especially of the tumor suppressor p53. Expression of suicidal genes in prostate cancer cells using prostate-specific promoter and enhancer elements as well as targeting of the androgen receptor or the insulin-like growth factor genes with triplex technology in prostate cancer cells and their metastases, is expected to be of therapeutic value.
9181357	Genetics of type III hyperlipoproteinemia.	One hundred forty-seven relatives of 43 patients with "classical" type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) having the apolipoprotein (apo) E2/2 phenotype were studied to determine the occurrence of hyperlipidemia and the presence of further possible genes for lipoprotein disorders in these families. In 12 pedigrees primary dyslipidemia was prevalent among patients and respective blood-relatives. In these kindreds the coexistent presence of genes for familial combined hyperlipidemia (n = 6), familial hypertriglyceridemia (n = 5), and familial hypercholesterolemia (n = 1), respectively, was supposed. Our results, therefore, confirm and extend previous data on the multifactorial genesis of the diseases. Besides homozygosity for a receptor binding-defective isoform of apo E (apo E2), additional genes for familial lipoprotein disorders might operate in the pathogenesis of type III HLP. This is the largest family study performed so far in this primary lipoprotein disorder.
9184166	Differential phosphorylation of pp120 by insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors: role for the C-terminal domain of the beta-subunit.	pp 120, a plasma membrane glycoprotein expressed by hepatocytes, is a substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. Since insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin receptors are structurally homologous, we investigated whether pp120 is also a substrate of the IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase. IGF-1 receptor failed to phosphorylate pp120 in response to IGF-1 in stably transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. However, replacement of the C-terminal domain of the beta-subunit of the IGF-1 receptor with the corresponding fragment in the insulin receptor restored ligand-stimulated pp120 phosphorylation, suggesting that this domain plays a regulatory role in pp120 phosphorylation. Since pp120 is the first identified substrate specific for the insulin vis-à-vis the IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase, the pp120 signaling pathway may constitute a novel mechanism for the distinct cellular effects of insulin and IGF-1, the former being principally involved in metabolism, and the latter in mitogenesis.
9184179	Expression of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), their receptors and IGF binding protein-3 in normal, benign and malignant smooth muscle tissues.	To assess the role of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in growth and transformation of normal (myometrium) and tumorous smooth muscle cell (SMC) tissues, in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis for insulin-like growth factor I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) mRNAs was combined with detection of IGF peptides, their receptors and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). mRNAs for both IGFs were detected in smooth muscle cells in normal, benign and malignant SMC tissues, together with the IGF peptides, both IGF receptors and IGFBP-3. This suggests an autocrine role for both IGFs. Leiomyomas had higher IGF-I peptide levels and higher levels of type I IGF receptors than myometrium, supporting the idea that IGFs play a role in the growth and transformation of these tumours. Low-grade leiomyosarcomas contained more IGF-II mRNAs than myometrium and leiomyoma, fewer type II IGF/mannose 6-phosphate receptors and less IGFBP-3 than myometrium and, in addition, fewer IGF-I mRNAs and type I IGF receptors than leiomyoma. Intermediate- and high-grade leiomyosarcomas had intermediate levels of IGF-II mRNAs and peptide, ranging between those in myometrium and low-grade leiomyosarcomas. Thus, growth and transformation of leiomyosarcomas may be regulated by IGF-II, although more markedly in low-grade than in high-grade leiomyosarcomas. In conclusion, the various categories of SMC tissues are associated with a distinct expression pattern of the IGF system. This suggests that each category of SMC tumours arises as a distinct entity and that there is no progression of transformation in these tissues.
9185968	Chromogranin A plasma concentration and expression in pancreatic islet cell tumors of dogs and cats.	OBJECTIVES: To describe expression of the neuroendocrine marker chromogranin A (CgA) in canine and feline pancreatic islet cell tumors and their metastases, and to evaluate plasma CgA concentration in dogs and cats with insulinoma. SAMPLE POPULATION: Paraffin-embedded tissues from 25 canine and 2 feline pancreatic islet cell tumors, 5 canine and 6 feline exocrine pancreatic tumors, and normal pancreatic tissue from 2 dogs and 2 cats. Heparinized plasma samples from 3 dogs and 2 cats diagnosed with insulinoma, and 10 control plasma samples from each species. PROCEDURE: Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the 42 tissue specimens, using antisera against CgA, neuron-specific enolase, insulin, somatostatin, glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide. The 25 plasma samples were evaluated, using a soluble-phase, double-antibody, equilibrium radioimmunoassay directed against the amino- and carboxy-terminal peptides of bovine CgA. RESULTS: Chromogranin A expression was found in 76% of canine and 2 of 2 feline pancreatic islet cell tumors. Of 7 animals with CgA immunoreactivity in primary tumors, 6 also had CgA immunostaining of metastatic lesions. Plasma CgA concentration in 2 dogs with insulinoma (0.9, 1.0 ng/ml) exceeded the reference range established for 10 clinically normal control dogs (0.50 +/- 0.16 ng/ml). Feline plasma CgA samples had extensive nonspecific background immunoreactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Chromogranin A is a useful immunohistochemical marker for pancreatic tumors of neuroendocrine origin and their metastases. Plasma CgA concentration determined by radioimmunoassay was high in 2 dogs with insulinoma. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Immunohistochemical staining of tissues or cytologic specimens for CgA and/or neuron-specific enolase may help distinguish masses of unknown origin as neuroendocrine in nature. Increase in plasma CgA concentration may be useful diagnostically for animals with suspected neuroendocrine tumors.
9187620	Dietary soybean protein increases insulin receptor gene expression in Wistar fatty rats when dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid level is low.	To investigate the effects of different dietary fatty acids and proteins on glucose tolerance and insulin receptor gene expression, Wistar fatty rats (genetically obese, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and their lean littermates (8 wk old) were fed a casein or soybean protein diet containing 9% partially saturated beef tallow (plus 1% corn oil), 10% corn oil or 10% fish oil for 3 wk. In glucose tolerance tests, plasma insulin concentrations were significantly higher in obese rats fed corn oil or fish oil than in those fed partially saturated beef tallow, particularly in the soybean protein groups. However, plasma glucose concentrations were not significantly affected by dietary protein or fat. The insulin receptor mRNA concentrations in livers and adipose tissues were higher in rats fed soybean protein/partially saturated beef tallow than in those fed any other protein/fat combination. Dietary soybean protein may help to reduce the insulin resistance, but only when a diet low in polyunsaturated fatty acids is consumed. On the other hand, the insulin receptor mRNA concentrations in adipose tissue were generally lower in the obese rats of all dietary groups than in the lean rats, suggesting that insulin resistance may be due to a defect of insulin receptor gene expression.
9191061	Apparent protection from instability of repeat sequences in cancer-related genes in replication error positive gastrointestinal cancers.	Genomic instability at simple repeated sequences has been observed in various types of human cancers and is considered an important mechanism in tumorigenesis. Alterations at microsatellite loci have been reported scattered throughout the genome. Recently, the transforming growth factor-beta receptor type II (TGF-beta RII) and the insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGF-IIR) genes were shown to have inactivating mutations within coding microsatellite sequences. The demonstration of mutations in two growth regulatory genes supports the idea that other regulatory genes with repeat sequences may also be targets in tumours with defective mismatch repair. We examined genes involved in tumour suppression, cell adhesion and cell cycle regulation for mutations at small repeat sequences in replication error positive gastrointestinal cancers. Several polymorphisms were found which exhibited instability, but no other instability was present in the regions examined.
9191540	Denaturing gradient-gel electrophoresis screening of familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 in a mixed Asian cohort: two cases of arginine3500-->tryptophan mutation associated with a unique haplotype.	The Arg-to-Trp substitution at codon 3500 in the apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 gene is established as a cause of familial defective apo B-100 (FDB), a functional mutation, resulting in reduced LDL receptor binding and manifest hypercholesterolemia. In a search for similar mutations in 163 Malaysians, we screened the putative receptor-binding region (codons 3456-3553) of the apo B-100 gene by PCR amplification and denaturing gradient-gel electrophoresis. Four single-base mutations were detected and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Two females, a Chinese and a Malay, had the same CGG3500-->TGG mutation, resulting in an Arg3500-to-Trp substitution. This is the second published report of such an independent mutation involving the same codon as the established Arg3500-to-Gln mutation. The two other mutations detected, CTT3517-->CTG and GCC3527-->GCT, resulted in degenerate codons with no amino acid substitutions. All four mutations were associated with a unique apo B haplotype, different from those found in Caucasian FDB patients but concurring with that previously reported for two other Asians with FDB.
9195949	Tyr624 and Tyr628 in insulin receptor substrate-2 mediate its association with the insulin receptor.	In addition to the pleckstrin homology domain and the phosphotyrosine binding domain in insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2, a region between amino acids 591 and 786 in IRS-2 (IRS-2-(591-786)) binds to the insulin receptor. Based on peptide competition studies, this region interacts with the phosphorylated regulatory loop of the insulin receptor; we designate this region the kinase regulatory loop binding (KRLB) domain. Two tyrosine residues in the KRLB domain at positions 624 and 628 are crucial for this interaction. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the KRLB domain by the insulin receptor inhibits the binding to the receptor. These results reveal a novel mechanism regulating the interaction of the insulin receptor and IRS-2 that may distinguish the signal of IRS-2 from IRS-1.
9195961	Membrane-associated insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 inhibits insulin-like growth factor-I-induced insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signaling in ishikawa endometrial cancer cells.	The function of cell surface-associated insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) is controversial. Both inhibition and facilitation of IGF action as well as IGF-independent effects have been reported. We examined the influence of endogenous cell surface-associated IGFBPs on IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) function in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells by comparing the effects of IGF-I and its truncated analog des-(1-3)-IGF-I on several components of the IGF-IR signal transduction pathway in the absence of significant amounts of soluble IGFBPs. IGF-I and des-(1-3)-IGF-I are known to have similar affinities for IGF-IR, although the affinity of des-(1-3)-IGF-I for IGFBPs is greatly reduced. Here we show that the two ligands were equipotent not only in IGF-IR binding but also in receptor activation in NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing IGF-IR and possessing a relatively small number of cell surface-associated IGFBPs. In contrast, des-(1-3)-IGF-I manifested a remarkably higher potency as compared with IGF-I in inducing short and middle term cellular responses in IGF-IR-transfected Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells possessing a high number of both the receptor and the cell membrane-bound IGFBP-3. Thus, this difference in the effects of IGF-I and des-(1-3)-IGF-I can be attributed to the attenuation of IGF-I-mediated IGF-IR signaling by membrane-bound IGFBP-3.
9199203	Insulin-like growth factor I induces tumor hexokinase RNA expression in cancer cells.	Increased glycolysis is a characteristic of cancer cells. Though less efficient in energy production, it ensures continuous supply of energy and phosphometabolites for biosynthesis enabling metastatic and less vascularized cancer cells to proliferate even under hypoxic conditions. Since hexokinase is the first rate limiting enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, elevated levels of Type II like hexokinase in tumors are of great significance in this context. Under normal conditions insulin regulates expression of hexokinase Type II isoenzyme, which is predominantly expressed in muscle. On the other hand cancer cells overexpress insulin-like growth factors and their receptors which mimic many activities of insulin. This prompted us to examine a hypothesis that insulin-like growth factors may be responsible for overexpression of tumor hexokinase. Our experiments demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor I indeed induces hexokinase gene expression in a concentration and time dependent manner in two cancer cell lines we studied.
9201666	Genetic testing for susceptibility to breast cancer: findings from women's focus groups.	Before designing an intervention to assist women in making informed decisions about BRCA1 testing, we conducted focus groups with women who had breast cancer and unaffected women whose relatives had it to better understand women's knowledge, concerns about testing, and potential influences and support needs in making a decision about genetic testing for susceptibility to breast cancer. Findings show a general lack of knowledge about genetic testing for breast cancer and what it means to have a positive test result, a strong concern for family members, particularly daughters, to use information from testing to help them make better decisions about their health and lifestyle choices, a strong sense of altruism, particularly among affected women, about being tested to help other women, not just family, and various support needs surrounding the testing experience, including an active role for physicians in the decision process. The major advantages to testing seem to be for information that could help reduce uncertainty and assist with making future decisions about medical treatment and plans for surveillance and some lifestyle changes. The major disadvantages to testing were concerns about confidentiality and loss of insurance, the lack of proven options for women after testing, and stress from knowing one had the BRCA1 mutation. These focus group discussions show women's concerns and ambivalence about genetic testing. We need to provide women with balanced information about the positive and negative aspects of such testing, determine how best to involve physicians in women's decisions about testing, consider the effects of testing on family relationships, and provide more public education about what genetic testing is and what it means.
9205049	Deficient transforming growth factor-beta1 activation and excessive insulin-like growth factor II (IGFII) expression in IGFII receptor-mutant tumors.	The insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGFIIR) gene has been identified as a coding region target of microsatellite instability in human gastrointestinal (GI) tumors. IGFIIR normally has two growth-suppressive functions: it binds and stimulates the plasmin-mediated cleavage and activation of the latent transforming growth factor-beta1 (LTGF-beta1) complex, and it mediates the internalization and degradation of IGFII ligand, a mitogen. We used an immunohistochemical approach to determine whether IGFIIR mutation affected expression of these proteins in GI tumors. Four highly specific antibodies were used: LC(1-30), which recognizes the active form of TGF-beta1; anti-LTGF-beta1, which detects the LTGF-beta1 precursor protein; anti-IGFIIR; and anti-IGFII ligand. Twenty GI tumors either with (6 of 20) or without (14 of 20) known IGFIIR mutation were examined, along with matching normal tissues. Results were statistically significant in the following categories: (a) decreased active TGF-beta1 protein expression in IGFIIR-mutant tumor tissues versus matching normal tissues or IGFIIR-wild-type tumor tissues; (b) increased LTGF-beta1 protein expression in IGFIIR-mutant tumor tissues versus matching normal tissues or IGFIIR-wild-type tumor tissues; and (c) increased IGFII ligand protein expression in IGFIIR-mutant tumor tissues versus matching normal tissues or IGFIIR-wild-type tumor tissues. These data suggest that in genetically unstable GI tumors, mutation of a microsatellite within the coding region of IGFIIR functionally inactivates this gene, causing both diminished growth suppression (via decreased activation of TGF-beta1) and augmented growth stimulation (via decreased degradation of the IGFII ligand).
9205064	Tamoxifen interferes with the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.	The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) is involved in the control of breast cancer cell growth. The cytostatic activity of tamoxifen (Tam), a nonsteroidal antiestrogen, is partially mediated through interference with IGF-I-R-dependent proliferation, yet the effects of Tam on IGF-IR intracellular signaling have never been elucidated. Consequently, we investigated how Tam modifies the IGF-IR signaling pathway in estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells and in MCF-7-derived clones overexpressing either the IGF-IR (MCF-7/IGF-IR cells) or its major substrate, IRS-1 (MCF-7/IRS-1 cells). MCF-7/IGF-IR and MCF-7/IRS-1 cells exhibit greatly reduced estrogen growth requirements but retain estrogen receptors and express sensitivity to antiestrogens comparable to that in the parental cells. In all tested cell lines, regardless of the amplification of IGF signaling, a 4-day treatment with 10 nM Tam produced a similar cytostatic effect. In MCF-7 and MCF-7/IGF-IR cells, growth inhibition by Tam was associated with the reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IR in the presence of IGF-I; however, the basal level of the IGF-IR remained unaffected. Moreover, Tam inhibited both basal and IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which was accompanied by down-regulation of IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activity and reduced IRS-1/growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) binding. In contrast, under the same treatment, tyrosine phosphorylation of Src-homology/collagen proteins (SHC; another substrate of the IGF-IR) and SHC/GRB2 binding were elevated. The protein levels of the IGF-IR and IRS-1 were not modified by Tam, whereas SHC protein expression was either not affected or moderately decreased by the treatment. In summary, this work provides the first evidence that in MCF-7 cells, cytostatic effects of Tam are associated with the modulation of IGF-IR signaling, specifically with: (a) down-regulation of IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IR; (b) inhibition of IRS-1/phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase signaling; and (c) up-regulation of SHC tyrosine phosphorylation and increased SHC/GRB2 binding. It is hypothesized that dephosphorylation of IRS-1 could be a major contributing factor in Tam cytostatic activity.
9205065	A high ratio of insulin-like growth factor II/insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 messenger RNA as a marker for anaplasia in meningiomas.	Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) I and II have been implicated as autocrine or paracrine growth promoters. These growth factors bind to specific receptors, and the response is modulated by interaction with IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). We observed a strong correlation between anaplastic/atypical histopathology and a high IGF-II/IGFBP-2 mRNA ratio in a set of 68 sporadic meningiomas. A strong correlation was also found between clinical outcome and IGF-II/IGFBP-2 ratio, whereas previously used histochemical markers were less correlated to outcome. We suggest that a high IGF-II/IGFBP-2 mRNA ratio may be a sign of biologically aggressive behavior in meningiomas that can influence treatment strategies. We propose that low IGFBP-2 levels in combination with increased levels of IGF-II would result in more free IGF-II and consequently greater stimulation of proliferation.
9207225	The protein tyrosine phosphatase LAR has a major impact on insulin receptor dephosphorylation.	Transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) may act as regulators of the insulin receptor. Supporting this hypothesis, antisense suppression of the PTPase LAR in McA-RH7777 hepatoma cells increased insulin receptor signaling (Kulas et. al., J. Biol. Chem. (1996) 271, 748-754). The effects of decreased LAR expression may be mediated by decreased dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor. The rate of insulin receptor dephosphorylation was examined in situ, following elution of surface bound insulin at pH 4.0. In LAR antisense cells, dephosphorylation was prolonged by 2.6-fold with a t(1/2) of 87+/-11 sec compared to a t(1/2) of 34+/-6 sec in control cells. EGF receptor dephosphorylation was also prolonged in LAR antisense cells. These results are further evidence that LAR is a physiological regulator of the insulin receptor and is consistent with its direct interaction with the tyrosine phosphorylated insulin receptor.
9209829	Amylin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, calcitonin, and adrenomedullin: a peptide superfamily.	The calcitonin gene peptide superfamily consists of calcitonin (CT), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and amylin. CT and CGRP derive from the CT/CGRP gene, which is encoded on chromosome 11. Alternative splicing of the primary RNA transcript leads to the translation of CGRP and CT peptides in a tissue-specific manner. CGRP (a 37-amino-acid neuropeptide) and its receptors are widely distributed in the body, and it is the most potent endogenous vasodilatory peptide discovered so far. CT (a 32-amino-acid peptide) is, however, a hormone primarily involved in protecting the skeleton during periods of "calcium stress" such as growth, pregnancy, and lactation. CT derives from the C cells of the thyroid gland and is the most potent peptide inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Therefore, treatment with CT is highly effective for conditions associated with increased bone turnover such as Paget's disease, osteoporosis, Sudeck's atrophy, and hypercalcemia. Amylin (a 37-amino-acid peptide) is generated from a gene located on chromosome 12 (thought to be an evolutionary duplication of chromosome 11) and shares 46% amino acid sequence homology with CGRP and 20% with human CT. Amylin is predominantly located in the beta cells of the islets of the pancreas and may be involved in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes by deposition as amyloid within the pancreas, leading to beta cell destruction. Adrenomedullin, a recently discovered 52-amino-acid vasoactive peptide from adrenal tissue, shares 24% homology with CGRP and is also a member of this superfamily of peptides. A portion of the B-chain of insulin is strongly homologous to these four peptides. Not only does adrenomedullin (13-52) show 24% amino acid homology with CGRP, it also has a biological activity profile similar to that of CGRP.CGRP, CT, and amylin are related to the insulin gene superfamily of peptides, which may all have diverged from a common ancestral gene during evolution. When the crystallographic- and nuclear magnetic resonance-based molecular modeling of the three-dimensional structure of CGRP, CT, amylin, and adrenomedullin peptides and their receptors is available, it will lead to a greater understanding of the involvement of this family of peptides in pathophysiology. Together, CGRP, CT, amylin and adrenomedullin have overlapping biological effects owing to their structures and cross-reactivity between receptors. I propose that CT, CGRP, adrenomedullin, and amylin belong to a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (an "insulin superfamily" of peptides) and therefore share some of the characteristics of insulin, such as growth factor-like effects, and possible interaction at insulin receptor sites as an antagonist.
9218732	Expression of high-affinity 67-kDa laminin receptors in primary breast cancers and metachronous metastatic lesions or contralateral cancers.	The presence of high-affinity 67-kDa laminin receptors, detected immunohistochemically, was determined on 63 primary breast cancers and on metachronous metastatic lesions or contralateral cancers from the same patients. A disagreement was observed in two-thirds of the cases. In particular, laminin receptor content was significantly lower (P = 0.02) in local recurrences and slightly higher in lymph node metastasis than in the corresponding primary tumours.
9222417	Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in colon carcinoma.	Colon carcinoma is the most common tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. According to some investigators, insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) man be involved in the neoplastic proliferation. Insulin-binding and receptor tyrosine kinase activity were investigated in colon carcinomas and in normal colons. The insulin receptor concentration, as shown by binding assays, was 17.4 +/- 4.3 fmol/micrograms in normal colon and 29.69 +/- 9.4 fmol/micrograms in colon carcinoma. Nevertheless, the insulin affinity of the receptor was similar in both groups (Kd identical to 1 nM). Both normal and neoplastic colon showed phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. The electrophoretic migration of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptors purified from colon carcinomas was similar to that of normal colon and both tissues demonstrated an insulin-dependent autophosphorylation. The receptor tyrosine kinase activity was measured by the incorporation of [gamma 32P]ATP into the beta-subunit. The basal and the insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activities were significantly higher in colon carcinomas compared to normal colon tissues (2.2 and 1.6 times, respectively). Understanding the metabolism of neoplastic cells may contribute to the development of prevention strategies as well as new therapies. It is now necessary to study other steps of the insulin signal transduction pathway, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation.
9234922	Infrared spectroscopy of normal and abnormal cervical smears: evaluation by principal component analysis.	Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of malignant and dysplastic cervical scrapings were abnormal, as first described in our study of a limited number of samples, where the spectra were evaluated by visual inspection and peak intensity ratios. We have expanded our study to evaluate more cervical conditions, and to analyze the spectra by a chemometric approach (principal component analysis [PCA]). Cervical samples from 436 females were evaluated by FT-IR and Papanicolaou testing; 40/436 spectra were nonanalyzable. The remaining were as follows: normal, 174; malignant, 19; dysplasia, 8; atypia, 113; atrophy, 19; inflammatory, 47; bloody smear, 12; hypocellular, 4. PCA analysis followed by chi2 test revealed that statistically significant frequencies of being predicted malignant by FT-IR were associated with samples diagnosed as malignant (P < 0.0001), and also those diagnosed as "atrophy" (P < 0.001), "atypical with bloody smear" (P < 0.05), "atypical with atrophic pattern" (P < 0.05), and "dysplasia" (P < 0.05). Based on these findings, for the diagnosis of cervical cancer by FT-IR, as defined here, the sensitivity is 79%, the specificity is 77%, the positive predictive value is 15%, and the negative predictive value is 98.6%. Our findings (a) demonstrate the application of a chemometric approach to the study of cervical FT-IR spectra; (b) assess its potential diagnostic role; (c) suggest that atrophic and neoplastic samples share structural features; and (d) suggest that blood may interfere with such spectroscopic evaluation. These findings warrant further evaluation of FT- IR spectroscopy in cervical and other malignancies.
9235956	Insulin and interleukin-4 induce desensitization to the mitogenic effects of insulin-like growth factor-I. Pivotal role for insulin receptor substrate-2.	Insulin-induced desensitization to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) stimulated mitogenesis in bovine fibroblasts involves steps distal to IGF-I binding to its tyrosine kinase receptor. When quiescent cultures of bovine fibroblasts were stimulated with 10 nM IGF-I and total cell lysates immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, we observed a band at approximately 97 kDa, representing the beta-subunit of the IGF-I receptor, and a predominant tyrosyl-phosphorylated species migrating as a broad band between 170 and 190 kDa. The majority of proteins in this latter band were immunoprecipitated by antibodies against insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 and not by antibodies against IRS-1. Pretreatment of bovine fibroblasts with 10 nM insulin for 48 h blocked subsequent IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis and the IGF-I-induced increase in tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRS-2. Insulin pretreatment did not alter IRS-1 or IRS-2 expression by these cells, as assessed by metabolic labeling and direct immunoblotting with IRS antibodies. The interleukin-4 (IL-4) cytokine receptor also has IRS-2 as its major substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation. Although 10 nM IL-4 was as effective as 10 nM IGF-I in stimulating IRS-2 phosphorylation, 10 nM IL-4 did not have comparable mitogenic power in these cells. Nonetheless, pretreatment of bovine fibroblasts with IL-4 inhibited IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis by 50-60%, concomitant with a decrease in IGF-I-induced IRS-2 phosphorylation. Insulin-induced desensitization could be prevented if a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002), but not an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (PD98059), was present during the preincubation period. LY294002 also prevented the shift in IRS-2 molecular mass in response to prolonged incubation of cells with insulin. These data indicate that, in a nontransformed cell system, IRS-2 plays a key role in cellular desensitization to IGF-I-stimulated mitogenesis most likely through a feedback mechanism in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Furthermore, they suggest that signaling through IRS-2 may provide an important point of integration for hormone, growth factor, and cytokine receptor systems that regulate critical cellular growth responses.
9240761	Analysis of candidate genes for insulin resistance in essential hypertension.	To clarify the genetic basis of insulin resistance in hypertension, case-control association studies were performed to examine candidate genes for insulin resistance in hypertension. Since the main site of insulin resistance in hypertension is glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle, genes that encode molecules involved in this pathway, i.e. insulin receptor (INSR), insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT4) and glycogen synthase (GSY), were studied. In addition, since recent studies suggest the contribution of beta3 adrenergic receptor to the insulin resistance syndrome, the gene encoding beta3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) was also studied. Frequency of homozygotes for common C allele of a microsatellite polymorphism in the INSR gene was higher in the hyperinsulinemia group, but not in the normoinsulinemia group of hypertensive patients than in normotensive control subjects. Insulin sensitivity, however, was not significantly different between hypertensive patients with C/C genotype and those without this genotype. No significant differences were observed in the distribution of alleles or genotypes of the GLUT4, GSY and ADRB3 genes between hyperinsulinemia and normoinsulinemia groups of hypertensive patients or between these groups and the control group. These data suggest that the INSR polymorphism is associated with hyperinsulinemia, but not with insulin resistance, in hypertension.
9247738	Insulin receptor gene in hypertension.	The first molecular genetic association with human essential hypertension (HT) involved the insulin receptor gene (INSR). This highly significant result in Caucasians was for an insertion/deletion polymorphism in intron 9. A polymorphism in exon 8 showed a weak association, but a microsatellite in intron 2 proved negative for HT, although has shown an association with plasma insulin in Japanese. A similar spectrum of genetic associations for variants spanning INSR has been noted for insulin-dependent diabetic patients with rapidly-progressing renal disease, a subgroup having a strong family history of essential HT. Association with HT has also been found for an INSR variant in CHinese. Insulin resistance secondary to an INSR 'defect', or other causes, would increase insulin, which has cardiovascular effects, and insulin can raise angiotensinogen. Also, insulin is co-secreted with amylin, which can increase renin secretion. In the spontaneously HT rat there is evidence for reduced down-regulation of INSR expression in response to NaCl-loading, consistent with a promoter effect. When combined with observations of insulin resistance in essential HT patients and their pre-HT offspring, the possibility of dys-regulation of INSR merits attention in disease etiology in a proportion of essential HT patients.
9255756	Insulin receptors in mouse brain: age-related modifications are corrected by thymus graft.	Recently, we have shown that insulin receptors (InsRs) in the brain undergo impairment with aging, as happens for other receptors such as alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. Age-related alterations of adrenoceptors, which are modulated by brain InsRs, are not definitive as they can be recovered by a thymus graft. In this study we verified the possibility that the thymus graft can also recover the age-dependent modifications of brain InsRs. InsR characteristics were assayed in a group of 27 months old Balb/c-nu mice grafted with a neonatal thymus, under renal capsule, one month before the animals were killed. Another two groups of young (3 months) and old (27 months) mice were used as controls. A two-sites model analysis of receptor data confirmed the age-dependent decrease of InsR density previously observed in the high affinity population. Furthermore, a statistically significant recovery of this impairment was shown in thymus grafted animals. The low affinity receptor subset also showed some differences among the three animal models; however, they were not statistically significant. Thymus graft induced recovery of the age-related changes found in brain InsRs, together with the similar one observed on the adrenergic system, calls for deeper studies of their interaction and the role they can play on aging processes.
9260838	Location of insulin receptors in the placenta and its progenitor tissues.	The insulin receptor gene is constitutively expressed, so the presence of insulin receptor proteins might be expected on all mammalian tissues, with the plasma membrane as the predominant site of receptor location. Results reviewed here indicate that insulin receptors are also present in all placental tissues and the placenta's progenitor tissues and cells, i.e., oocytes, spermatozoa, and preimplantation embryos, in most of the species studied. Receptor densities, however, vary among individual cells and cell types and at various developmental stages. Three aspects deserve emphasis. 1) In human placenta, the insulin receptor distribution pattern is characterized by a spatiotemporal change between first trimester and term. At the beginning of pregnancy, insulin receptors are found predominantly on the maternal side (apical membrane of syncytiotrophoblast, low density on cytotrophoblast); at term, however, they are on the fetal side (lining the fetal vessels). This suggests that, in the first trimester, maternal insulin regulates insulin-dependent processes, whereas, at term, it must be fetal insulin mainly controlling these processes. 2) The majority of insulin receptors is expressed on structures that are currently assumed to drive placental growth, i.e., syncytial sprouts and mesenchymal villi in first-trimester placentas and fetal endothelium at term. Therefore, we hypothesize a growth-promoting function, among others, of insulin on the placenta. 3) At present, no histologic evidence is available to demonstrate insulin receptors in structures commonly associated with receptor-mediated endocytosis. Whether placental insulin receptors are internalized, therefore, awaits clarification.
9267840	The scope of gene therapy in humans: scientific, safety and ethical considerations.	Gene therapy entails the introduction of specific, functional genes into cells for therapeutic or preventive purposes. Therapeutic genes may be introduced into cells in vitro (and the treated cells then introduced into the patient) or directly in vivo. Gene therapy may be used for several purposes including: (a) Gene replacement in genetic diseases; (b) Destroying malignant cells in neoplastic diseases; (c) Modifying immune responses; (d) Providing trophic molecules; (e) Immunisation against infectious diseases. In designing gene therapy strategies the following major items need to be investigated and optimised: (1) Relevant biological characteristics of the treatable cells and tissues; (2) Gene vectors (viral or non-viral); (3) The gene expression cassette (promoter+cDNA+poly A signal); (4) The safest and most effective route of administration; (5) Longevity of the transgene expression. Before human trials for gene therapy can commence for a given disease, extensive preclinical studies are to be carried out in an appropriate experimental models to assure the feasibility, safety and efficiency of the enterprise. For each disease or application, the risk/benefit ratio must be determined. Permission by regulatory agencies, institutional review boards (IRB) and thorough informed consent are essential. Although gene therapy holds great promise for many human diseases, it is still too early to predict the extent and timetable of its successful implementation in individual diseases.
9267874	Granulopoiesis in newly diagnosed childhood solid tumors.	Granulopoiesis at the diagnosis of solid tumors has not been previously reported. The purpose of this study is to detect the changes of granulopoiesis of patients with solid tumors in different clinical stages. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) assays and liquid suspension cultures of bone marrow and peripheral blood were studied in 90 children with newly diagnosed solid tumors, including 5 benign tumors and 85 malignant tumors. The malignant tumors were categorized into nonadvanced, advanced, or marrow-invaded ones. Bone marrow from children with immune thrombocytopenic purpura and peripheral blood from adult volunteers were used as controls. Granulocyte-macrophage colony formation from bone marrow in benign or nonadvanced malignant tumor was not significantly different from that of controls. However, granulocyte macrophage colony formation from bone marrow in advanced or marrow-invaded malignant tumor was significantly less than that of controls or nonadvanced malignant tumor. Furthermore, the bone marrow of patients with advanced malignant tumor occasionally had a defective proliferation pattern and the bone marrow of those with marrow-invaded malignant tumor often had a defective proliferation pattern. Peripheral blood in marrow-invaded malignant tumor had colony and cluster formations in very wide ranges. As a malignant tumor progresses into advanced stages, irrespective of marrow infiltration, bone marrow CFU-GM levels may decline and defective granulopoiesis may occur.
9268713	Functional importance of heat shock protein 90 associated with insulin receptor on insulin-stimulated mitogenesis.	The role of stress proteins on the function of insulin receptor is not well understood. In the rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing human insulin receptors, heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 was co-immunoprecipitated with insulin receptors and the association was not affected by insulin stimulation. A GST-fusion protein containing the intracellular insulin receptor beta subunit was associated with Hsp 90 in vitro, suggesting the direct interaction of this protein with insulin receptor beta-subunit. Furthermore, microinjection of anti-Hsp 90 antibody into these cells completely inhibited insulin-stimulated mitogenesis. However, neither epidermal growth factor-stimulated nor serum-stimulated mitogenic signal in the cells was affected by the antibody microinjection. These results suggest that Hsp 90 constitutively binds to insulin receptor beta-subunit, which may be necessary for insulin signaling in mitogenesis.
9275088	Role of prepancreatic (pro)insulin and the insulin receptor in prevention of embryonic apoptosis.	The characterization of (pro)insulin as an early embryonic growth factor requires demonstration of its expression and cellular effects in vivo. By in situ hybridization, we found widespread preproinsulin transcripts in the chick embryo throughout gastrulation and neurulation, before the beginning of preproinsulin-like growth factor I expression and pancreatic organogenesis. To analyze the prepancreatic (pro)insulin effect on apoptotic cell death, we treated embryos with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides in ovo and in vitro. The specific effect of two preproinsulin messenger RNA (mRNA) antisense oligodeoxynucleotides was confirmed by the decrease in a biosynthetically labeled protein immunoprecipitated with antiinsulin Igs. Insulin receptor mRNA antisense oligodeoxynucleotide applied in ovo increased by 2.7-fold the level of apoptosis in the 1.5-day embryo (neurulation) compared with that in its random sequence control. In a whole embryo culture, apoptosis increased by 25-35% with the addition of preproinsulin or insulin receptor mRNAs antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, respectively, whereas it decreased by 64% after 10 h in the presence of 10(-8) M chicken insulin. Exogenous insulin also rescued the death induced by preproinsulin antisense oligonucleotides. These findings provide evidence for an autocrine/paracrine role ofpreproinsulin gene products acting through the insulin receptor in the control of cell survival/death during early embryonic development.
9281335	Growth-promoting interaction of IGF-II with the insulin receptor during mouse embryonic development.	Genetic analyses of dwarfing phenotypes resulting from targeted mutagenesis of the genes encoding the insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) and their cognate type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R) have demonstrated that this signaling system is a major determinant of mouse embryonic growth. Of the two IGF ligands, IGF-I interacts exclusively with IGF1R, whereas IGF-II recognizes an additional receptor (XR), because the growth retardation of embryos lacking both IGR1R and IGF-II (30% of normal birthweight) is more severe than that manifested in either class of single Igf1r or Igf2 null mutants (45 and 60% of normal, respectively). To determine whether XR is the insulin receptor (IR), we examined embryos nullizygous for both Igf1r and Insr. While the growth of embryos lacking solely IR is affected very mildly and only at the end of gestation, concomitant absence of IGF1R results in a severe growth-deficiency phenotype (30% of normal size at birth) that is first detected at Embryonic Day 13.5 and is also characterized by transient edema, curly tail, generalized organ hypoplasia, including the muscles, developmental delays in ossification, and thin epidermis. The Igf1r/Insr double nullizygotes are phenotypically indistinguishable from double mutants lacking IGF1R and IGF-II and from other double and triple mutants in which all of the IGF ligand/receptor interactions have been eliminated. Therefore, these results provide genetic evidence that the growth-promoting function of IGF-II during mouse embryogenesis is mediated in part by signaling through the insulin receptor.
9299395	Four mutant alleles of the insulin receptor gene associated with genetic syndromes of extreme insulin resistance.	We identified four novel mutant alleles of the insulin receptor gene in three patients with genetic syndromes associated with insulin resistance. Two mutant alleles of the insulin receptor gene were identified in a patient with the Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome who was a compound heterozygote for a mutation at the 3'-splice acceptor site of intron 4 (AG-->GG), the first mutation causing an aberrant splicing at this locus, and a deletion of eight base pairs in exon 12. The second patient with leprechaunism was also a compound heterozygote for a deletion of one base pair in exon 19 and a mutation, Thr910-->Met, which causes impaired receptor processing. Interestingly, the third patient with type A syndrome was a simple heterozygote for the identical one base pair deletion. The fact that the same one base pair deletion links to type A in a simple heterozygote and to leprechaunism in a compound heterozygote appears consistent with the hypothesis that the severity of mutations will determine the phenotype.
9302374	Expression of the putative inhibitor of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase PC-1 in dermal fibroblasts from patients with syndromes of severe insulin resistance.	OBJECTIVE: To date, mutations in the insulin receptor gene are the only clearly defined cause of extreme insulin resistance in man. Recently, however, some patients with severe insulin resistance have been reported to have marked over-expression of the transmembrane glycoprotein PC-1 in their cultured fibroblasts. This protein appears to act as an endogenous inhibitor of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase which suggests that primary over-expression of PC-1 may play an aetiological role in some forms of insulin resistance. One sub-type of extreme insulin resistance in which the insulin receptor gene has been reported to be normal is pseudo-acromegalic insulin resistance. The main aim of this study was to determine whether overexpression of PC-1 might contribute to the severe insulin resistance exhibited by some patients with pseudo-acromegaly. DESIGN AND PATIENTS PC-1 phosphodiesterase activity and PC-1 protein and mRNA content were measured in cultured dermal fibroblast from three severely insulin resistant pseudo-acromegalic patients. These were compared with fibroblasts from normoinsulinaemic normoglycaemic controls and from subjects with known genetic defects in the insulin receptor or IRS-1. RESULTS: In the fibroblasts from pseudo-acromegalic insulin resistant subjects PC-1 activity and PC-1 protein and mRNA levels were indistinguishable from the normoinsulinaemic controls. Consistent with this observation, insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity was similar in extracts from fibroblasts of pseudo-acromegalic subjects and normal controls. Surprisingly, subjects with insulin receptor or IRS-1 mutations had a profound reduction in PC-1 activity (p < or = 0.005), protein (p < or = 0.05) and mRNA levels (P < or = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that PC-1 over-expression does not appear to contribute to the insulin resistant state of pseudo-acromegalic patients. The finding of normal insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in these subjects suggests that the site of defective insulin signalling is likely to be distal to the receptor. The unexpected finding that PC-1 activity, protein and mRNA were all dramatically reduced in patients with lesions early in the insulin signalling cascade provides further evidence for a link, albeit as yet poorly understood, between cellular insulin action and the expression of PC-1.
9311601	Differential roles of IRS-1 and SHC signaling pathways in breast cancer cells.	Several polypeptide growth factors stimulate breast cancer growth and may be involved in tumor progression. However, the relative importance of diverse growth factor signaling pathways in the development and maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype is largely unknown. The activation of such growth factor receptors as the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-I R), erbB-type receptors (erbB Rs) and FGF receptors (FGF Rs) controls the phenotype of a model breast cancer cell line MCF-7. To evaluate the function of 2 post-receptor signaling molecules, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) (a major substrate of the IGF-IR) and SHC (a common substrate of tyrosine kinase receptors), we developed several MCF-7-derived cell clones in which the synthesis of either IRS-1 or SHC was blocked by antisense RNA. In MCF-7 cells, down-regulation of IRS-1 by 80-85% strongly suppressed anchorage-dependent and -independent growth and induced apoptotic cell death under growth factor- and estrogen-reduced conditions. The reduction of SHC levels by approximately 50% resulted in the inhibition of monolayer and anchorage-independent growth but did not decrease cell survival. Importantly, cell aggregation and the ability of cells to survive on the extracellular matrix were inhibited in MCF-7/anti-SHC clones, but not in MCF-7/anti-IRS-1 clones. Cell motility toward IGF was not attenuated in any of the tested cell lines, but motility toward EGF was decreased in MCF-7/anti-SHC clones. Our results suggest that in MCF-7 cells: 1) both IRS-1 and SHC are implicated in the control of monolayer and anchorage-independent growth; 2) IRS-1 is critical to support cell survival; 3) SHC is involved in EGF-dependent motility; and 4) normal levels of SHC, but not IRS-1, are necessary for the formation and maintenance of cell-cell interactions.
9312143	14-3-3 protein binds to insulin receptor substrate-1, one of the binding sites of which is in the phosphotyrosine binding domain.	Insulin binding to its receptor induces the phosphorylation of cytosolic substrates, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2, which associate with several Src homology-2 domain-containing proteins. To identify unique IRS-1-binding proteins, we screened a human heart cDNA library with 32P-labeled recombinant IRS-1 and obtained two isoforms (epsilon and zeta) of the 14-3-3 protein family. 14-3-3 protein has been shown to associate with IRS-1 in L6 myotubes, HepG2 hepatoma cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and bovine brain tissue. IRS-2, a protein structurally similar to IRS-1, was also shown to form a complex with 14-3-3 protein using a baculovirus expression system. The amount of 14-3-3 protein associated with IRS-1 was not affected by insulin stimulation but was increased significantly by treatment with okadaic acid, a potent serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor. Peptide inhibition experiments using phosphoserine-containing peptides of IRS-1 revealed that IRS-1 contains three putative binding sites for 14-3-3 protein (Ser-270, Ser-374, and Ser-641). Among these three, the motif around Ser-270 is located in the phosphotyrosine binding domain of IRS-1, which is responsible for the interaction with the insulin receptor. Indeed, a truncated mutant of IRS-1 consisting of only the phosphotyrosine binding domain retained the capacity to bind to 14-3-3 protein in vivo. Finally, the effect of 14-3-3 protein binding on the insulin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was investigated. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that IRS-1 coimmunoprecipitated with anti-14-3-3 antibody to be weakly phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, on tyrosine as well as serine residues, compared with IRS-1 immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibody. Thus, the association with 14-3-3 protein may play a role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity by interrupting the association between the insulin receptor and IRS-1.
9331069	Genetic alterations accumulate during cervical tumorigenesis and indicate a common origin for multifocal lesions.	Carcinomas of the uterine cervix are thought to arise from preinvasive dysplastic lesions, termed cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN), grades I-III. Patients may present clinically with two or more distinct lesions of differing histological severity; however, the genesis of these multifocal lesions is unknown. Despite infection with high-risk human papilloma virus subtypes, which is a major etiological factor in disease pathogenesis, only a small and unpredictable number of dysplastic lesions progress to invasive cancer. Several lines of evidence suggest that additional somatic events, such as tumor suppressor gene inactivation, are required for malignant transformation. In support of this, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses of invasive cervical carcinomas have identified several chromosomal arms likely to harbor tumor suppressor genes, of which regions on 3p, 4p, 4q, and 11q have been validated extensively. To evaluate the potential role of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in dysplastic progression, loci distributed on these four chromosomal regions were assessed for LOH in 42 CIN lesions of varying histological grade obtained from 17 patients. Analysis of at least 16 microsatellite loci in each lesion revealed allelic losses involving one or more of these chromosomal regions in 0% of CIN I lesions; 25% of CIN II lesions; and 88% of CIN III lesions, with 41% of CIN III lesions exhibiting LOH for three or more chromosomal regions. In addition, where LOH was scored for the same locus at a particular chromosomal region in all of the multiple lesions from a single patient, the same allele was lost at each locus, without exception. Statistical analysis of these allele-specific losses strongly suggests that topologically distinct lesions are related and likely arise from a common precursor cell.
9332364	Disrupted cholecystokinin type-A receptor (CCKAR) gene in OLETF rats.	OLETF rats develop hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and mild obesity, which is characteristic of human non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). We cloned and sequenced the cholecystokinin type-A receptor (CCKAR) gene in the rats. Comparing the DNA sequences of the OLETF CCKAR gene and LETO CCKAR gene, normal gene, we found a deletion in the OLETF gene, 6847 bases in length, which was flanked by two 3-base-pair direct repeats (5'-TGT-3') at positions -2407/-2405 and 4441/4443, numbered according to the LETO gene sequence, one of which was lost. The promoter region, the first and second exons were missing in the mutant. The region upstream and downstream of the deletion, including exons 3, 4 and 5, was conserved between the two strains, and did not contain any base changes. We found that the gene mapped to chromosome 14 in rats. OLETF rats are the naturally occurring knockout animals with the homozygously disrupted CCKAR gene.
9335502	Protection from obesity-induced insulin resistance in mice lacking TNF-alpha function.	Obesity is highly associated with insulin resistance and is the biggest risk factor for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The molecular basis of this common syndrome, however, is poorly understood. It has been suggested that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a candidate mediator of insulin resistance in obesity, as it is overexpressed in the adipose tissues of rodents and humans and it blocks the action of insulin in cultured cells and whole animals. To investigate the role of TNF-alpha in obesity and insulin resistance, we have generated obese mice with a targeted null mutation in the gene encoding TNF-alpha and those encoding the two receptors for TNF-alpha. The absence of TNF-alpha resulted in significantly improved insulin sensitivity in both diet-induced obesity and that resulting for the ob/ob model of obesity. The TNFalpha-deficient obese mice had lower levels of circulating free fatty acids, and were protected from the obesity-related reduction in the insulin receptor signalling in muscle and fat tissues. These results indicate that TNF-alpha is an important mediator of insulin resistance in obesity through its effects on several important sites of insulin action.
9340870	[Alzheimer's disease and genes].	Alzheimer's disease is genetically heterogeneous. The rare familial early-onset form of the disease is caused by dominant mutations in at least four different genes. Three of these genes have now been identified and the gene for presenilin 1 (PS1) on chromosome 14 is mutated in about 75% of the families. By contrast, the common form of Alzheimer's disease has late onset and may occur as sporadic cases in the families. This form is multifactorial and the most important genetic risk factor is the E4 allele of the polymorphic apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) on chromosome 19. The E4 allele is associated with moderately or strongly increased lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease in persons with respectively one or two copies of the gene variant. Apolipoprotein E genotyping may serve as an adjunct in the diagnostic evaluation of Alzheimer's disease, but predictive genotyping of asymptomatic persons is premature and should not be done.
